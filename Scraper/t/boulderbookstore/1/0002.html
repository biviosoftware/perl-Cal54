SUMMARY:Local Authors Afternoon 
DESCRIPTION:<p>
 Join us for an afternoon with local Boulder authors Cara Lopez Lee\, Carolyn Jones\, Kathy Guyton and Kristen Moeller! 
 </p>
 <p>
 Cara Lopez Lee\, author of <em>They Only Eat Their Husbands</em>. “A delightfully engaging read. Lee reminds us that in travel as in life\, the inward journey is as messy\, important and rewarding as the outward one.”<br />
 —Kyle Wagner\, travel editor\, The Denver Post</p>
 <p>Carolyn Jones\, author of <em>Opening the Gates of the Heart</em>. This is a book that speaks to those on a journey of self-awareness\, healing\, and awakening. Through up-lifting prose and photographs\, award-winning author and photographer Carolyn Jones shares with us her own journey of emotional and spiritual healing\, from feelings of worthlessness and deep despair\, to joy and peace.</p>
 <p>Kathy Guyton\, author of <em>U.S. State Names</em>.  &quot\;Whether you have a specific state in mind or want to know a little bit about all of them\, this is a fun book to read. Even the states you think are fairly obvious (like Virginia) there's more to the story than you thought. My target states were Arizona and California (and both were interesting to read!) but I have enjoyed randomly reading other chapters.&quot\; <br />
 —Liza Weissler</p>
 <p>Kristen Moeller\, author of <em>Waiting for Jack</em>. “By the end of this book and your personal exploration\, you will see where you wait for life to begin. You will see that all the answers you need come from within. You will learn to stop hiding your magnificence and stop jacking around. You will become\, as Kristen proclaims\, 'a fierce disruption of the ordinary.'&quot\; <br />
 —Jack Canfield\, Co-author\, Chicken Soup for the Soul
