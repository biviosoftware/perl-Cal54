Starting January 6, and during most of 2011, the BPL Cosmology discussion group will view and discuss a DVD lecture series from The Teaching Company, "Cosmology: The History and Nature of Our Universe", Taught By Professor Mark Whittle, Ph.D., University of Cambridge and University of Virginia.  This series of 36 half hour lectures covers the physics of the origin and evolution of the universe from the big bang to the present and beyond.  Topics include how the universe started in the big bang, the cosmic microwave background and what can be learned from it, the expansion of the universe, which has been found to be accelerating rather than slowing as previously thought, the "cosmological principle" that the universe is presumed to be roughly the same everywhere on very large scales, the composition of the universe which is only about 4% known, the formation of galaxies, stars, and the chemical elements, and the perhaps surprising outcome of all this that some parts of the universe are inhabitable.  For a full description of the series, with descriptions of each lecture, visit http://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1830.  To see books this group has discussed in the past, visit http://www.sackett.net/cosmology.htm.    We will watch each 30 minute lecture and then discuss it, and will attempt to cover two lectures in each meeting.  We will meet in the Boulder Creek Meeting Room on the first floor of the main Boulder Public Library on the first and third Thursdays of each month at 7-9 PM, beginning January 6.  (On 4/7,4/21,5/5,9/15/ and 10/6, we will meet in the Arapahoe Conference Room and will not be able to view DVDs, but will discuss related topics.)  These lectures will start out slowly and move into more advanced topics, but will stay within reach of laymen with a modest backgound in science.  For more information please visit http://www.sackett.net/cosmology.htm Contact:  jeff1.grove@gmail.com 303-581-9017  Expected Schedule (may slip):  January 6 1. The Journey Ahead Cosmology takes the entire universe as its subject, not just its form, structure, and contents, but also how it was born and how it has evolved. You look at the origin of cosmology in creation stories before taking a whirlwind tour of the whole course.  2. Denizens of the Universe This lecture introduces the hierarchy of structures in the universe: from planets to stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and larger groupings of galaxies called the cosmic web. Since light travels at a finite speed, looking far away also means looking far back in time.  January 20 3. Overall Cosmic Properties The universe is lumpy at the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters. But at larger scales it seems to be smooth and similar in all directions. This property of homogeneity and isotropy is called the cosmological principle.  4. The Stuff of the Universe The most familiar constituents of the universe are atomic matter and light. Neutrinos make up another component. But by far the bulk of the universe--96%--is dark energy and dark matter. The relative amounts of these constituents have changed as the universe has expanded.  February 3 5. The Sweep of Cosmic History Take a quick trip through the history of the universe, from the big bang to a conjectured future of ever-accelerating expansion. Eight key stages are in between, including the condensation of atoms, the birth of the first stars, and the formation of galaxies.  6. Measuring Distances Astronomers use a "distance ladder" of overlapping techniques to determine distances in the universe. Triangulation works for nearby stars. For progressively farther objects, observers use pulsating stars, the rotation of galaxies, and a special class of supernova explosions.  February 17 7. Expansion and Age Measurements of the Doppler shift of galaxies in the early 20th century revealed that essentially all were moving away from us. The more distant ones are moving faster, in direct proportion to their distance. This is the famous Hubble Law, which implies an initial "big bang."  8. Distances, Appearances, and Horizons Defining distances in cosmology is tricky, since an object\'s distance continually increases with cosmic expansion. There are three important distances to consider: the emission distance, when the light set out; the current distance, when the light arrives; and the distance the light has traveled.  March 3 9. Dark Matter and Dark Energy--96%! Atomic matter comprises less than 5% of the total cosmic census. This realization came with the discovery of dark matter (23%) in the 1970s and dark energy (73%) in the late 1990s. They are "dark" because they are detectable only by their subtle gravitational effects.  10. Cosmic Geometry--Triangles in the Sky ',

This film was produced by Peter Goldfarb of Boulder for the NBC Experiment in Television series.  A seminal work in Fellini¡¯s film canon, it is composed of episodes of his career during the time he was shooting Sytricon.  Included is a visit to the set of an abandoned film project The Voyage of G. Mastorna (it. title), research and casting for Sytricon, a scene cut from the final version of Nights of Cabiria (Le Notte Di Cabiria), journeys with Fellini through Rome and along the Via Appia and a visit to Marcello Mastroianni¡¯s house.

Student The Candidate Directed by Michael Ritchie, featuring Robert Redford, Peter Boyle, Don Porter, Allen Garfield (1972).   A California lawyer fights for the little man.  His charisma and integrity get him noticed by the Democratic Party machine and he is persuaded to run for the Senate against an apparently unassailable incumbent.  He\'s mainly running to bring certain political issues into the open, although he never actually plans to win.  It\'s agreed he can handle it his own way, on his own terms, but once he\'s in the race and his prospects begin to improve, the deal starts to change.  As time goes by, he realizes that whether or not he wins, he might not be able to hold on to his values. This film, shot in only 41 days, is one of the great motion pictures about the world of politics, demonstrating  how an idealistic and inexperienced young man can get trapped by the media. It holds up as well today as it did in 1972.  The film won a Best Writing Oscar and was also nominated for Best Sound.  Look for appearances by Natalie Wood, Groucho Marx, Howard K. Smith, and several real politicians of the day.  (109 min.)  ',

Buzzy Jackson, who lives in Louisville, is the author of "Shaking the Family Tree: Blue Bloods, Black Sheep, and Other Obsessions of an Accidental Genealogist" recently published by Simon and Schuster. She will read from the book, answer questions  from the audience and be available to sign her book, which will be for sale at the event.  "WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?"   As a historian, Buzzy Jackson thought she knew the answers to these simple questions--that is, until she took a look at her scrawny family tree. With a name like Jackson (the twentieth most common American surname), she knew she must have more relatives and more family history out there, somewhere. Her first visit to the Boulder Genealogy Society brought her more questions than answers . . . but it also gave her a tantalizing peek into the fascinating (and enormous) community of family-tree huggers and after-hours Alex Haleys.   In Shaking the Family Tree, Jackson dives headfirst into her family gene pool: flying cross-country to locate an ancient family graveyard, embarking on a weeklong genealogy Caribbean cruise, and even submitting her DNA for testing to try to find her Jacksons. And in the process of researching her own family lore (Who was Bullwhip Jackson?) she meets legions of other genealogy buffs who are as interesting as they are driven--from the boy who saved his allowance so he could order his great-grandfather\'s death certificate to the woman who spends her free time documenting the cemeteries of Colorado ghost towns.   Through Jackson\'s research she connects with distant relatives, traces her roots back more than 250 years and in the process comes to discover--genetically, historically, and emotionally--the true meaning of "family" for herself.

    'description' => 'Thursday January 27 What I Love About Boulder | John Fante Novelist & Screenwriter Raised in Boulder  6:30pm start Walk on the Wild Side Directed by Edward Dmytryk, with Laurence Harvey, Capucine, Jane Fonda, Anne Baxter, Barbra Stanwyck (1962).  This film is a high melodrama set in sultry, steamy, Depression-era New Orleans.  A handsome Texas dirt farmer hops a freight train and searches New Orleans high and low for his lost sweetheart, unaware that she works in the Doll House, the most notorious and corrupt bordello in the French Quarter.  He is aided in his quest by a runaway juvenile and a Mexican-American cafe owner, both of whom admire him and realize the nobility of his quest.  When a young, immoral and thieving temptress gets involved things begin to unravel leading to scandal and tragedy.  Director Edward Dmytryk was one of the "Hollywood Ten," a group of blacklisted film industry professionals, some of which served time in prison during the McCarthy-era "Red Scare."  Joseph MacDonald captures all the heat and steam of New Orleans with his shimmering black and white cinematography.  Elmer Bernstein\'s musical score is one of his best, and adds the right touch of jazzy glitz to the drama.  Saul Bass, considered one of the best film graphic designers of all time created the famous opening credits in which a sensuous black cat prowls along sidewalks and alleys of the Big Easy.  Based loosely on the 1956 novel by Nelson Algren, with screenplay by John Fante.   (114 min.)   ',

This film by Academy Award winning documentary filmmaker Will Roberts traces his odyssey from his boyhood in Lakewood, Colorado to Hollywood, California, from South America to Helsinki, Finland, from Italy to Russia, and finally to East Berlin, German Democratic Republic.  It explores Reed\'s career as singer, actor, writer, director, and political activist.  His story is told in his own words, music, film clips, and archives from around the world.  Reed died in East Berlin in 1986, and his remains are interned at Green Mountain Cemetery in Boulder.   In Russian, German and Spanish with subtitles.  (93 min.) ',

    'description' => 'This group meets monthly and discusses topics which address race in America. Connecting the Community with Children to Help End Racism  January The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness by Michelle Alexander Contrary to the rosy picture of race embodied in Barack Obama\'s political success and Oprah Winfrey\'s financial success, legal scholar Alexander argues vigorously and persuasively that we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it. Jim Crow and legal racial segregation has been replaced by mass incarceration as a system of social control (More African Americans are under correctional control today... than were enslaved in 1850). Alexander reviews American racial history from the colonies to the Clinton administration, delineating its transformation into the war on drugs. She offers an acute analysis of the effect of this mass incarceration upon former inmates who will be discriminated against, legally, for the rest of their lives, denied employment, housing, education, and public benefits. Most provocatively, she reveals how both the move toward colorblindness and affirmative action may blur our vision of injustice: most Americans know and don\'t know the truth about mass incarceration--but her carefully researched, deeply engaging, and thoroughly readable book should change that.  February Life on the Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy who Discovered He was Black by Gregory Howard Williams Gregory Howard Williams and his younger brother, Mike, grew up believing they were white and that their dark-skinned father was of Italian descent. Then their parents\' marriage disintegrated, their mother departed, and their father\'s business ventures sank into a sea of liquor. Pursued by debt and personal demons, "Tony" Williams took his two boys to his hometown of Muncie, Indiana, where he was known as "Buster," and where there was no escape from the truth he had hidden for so long. The truth was as plain as the color of Buster\'s family. Gregory and Mike Williams were the sons of a brilliant and charming but troubled man who fled the burden of race until need drove him back to his roots.  Suddenly Gregory and Mike had to straddle two worlds and two heritages -black and white.  Life on the Color Line is a wonderfully inspiring testament of purpose, perseverance, and human triumph.   March Inheriting the Trade by Thomas Norman DeWolf In the summer of 2001, Katrina Browne led nine distant family members on their own triangular passage as she made a documentary film (Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North) about their DeWolf ancestors, the largest slave-trading dynasty in early America--who transported 10,000 Africans to America and the Caribbean between 1769 and 1820. DeWolf, one of Browne\'s cousins, traces the journey in this soul-searching memoir, beginning in Bristol, R.I., the hub of the late-18th-century trade, and continuing to Ghana, Cuba and back to New England. At each station of the trip, the Family of Ten visits historic sites, and distinguished historians address the group about aspects of the slave trade. DeWolf\'s account gains immediacy as he reports these presentations and the ensuing group discussions, along with their personal struggles to come to terms with an ignominious family history and his own sharp learning curve. His narrative, however, bogs down toward its conclusion in an irrelevant account of allegations of sexual harassment made against him and a digressive though thought-provoking discussion of reparations for slavery. Nevertheless, DeWolf promotes conversation about truth of the past and its impact on the present.  April Just Like Us: The True Story of Four Mexican Girls Coming of Age in America  by Helen Thorpe By the time Marisela, Yadira, Clara and Elissa--four girls of Mexican descent from the suburbs of Denver--entered their freshman year in high school, they were inseparable, but four years later, their fundamental difference threatened to divide them: Clara and Elissa were legal residents, but Marisela and Yadira had begun to suffer the repercussions of their parents\' choice to illegally enter the U.S. Journalist Thorpe, married to Denver mayor John Hickenlooper, chronicles the girls\' lives over four years, delineating the small but arresting differences that will separate them and shape their futures. She personalizes the ongoing debate over immigration and frames it so compassionately and sensibly that even the staunchest opponents of immigration liberalization might find themselves rethinking their positions.  May White Boy: A Memoir by Mark Naison Growing up in then mostly Jewish and Italian Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in the 1950s and \'60s, Mark Naison saw white flight transform his neighborhood make his previously liberal Jewish parents openly racist. Naison grew up worshiping black athletes and musicians; as neighborhood tensions grew, he became more estranged from his parents and found himself',

Her plan is thrown into disarray when she meets an Italian-American, who is a struggling writer who comes to Los Angeles\'s Bunker Hill neighborhood to begin his writing career.

Fante was one of the first writers to portray the tough times faced by many people in Depression-era Los Angeles, and is sighted to have significantly influenced writer Charles Bukowski .  Tom Cruise (with Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions) is one of the film\'s producers.  Based on John Fante\'s most popular novel, Ask the Dust (first published 1939).

    'description' => 'Meets at 7 p.m. the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month in the Boulder Creek Meeting Room (except for 4/7,4/21,5/5,9/15/ and 10/6 when they will meet in the Arapahoe Conference Room at the Main Library. Starting January 6, and during most of 2011, the BPL Cosmology discussion group will view and discuss a DVD lecture series from The Teaching Company, "Cosmology: The History and Nature of Our Universe", Taught By Professor Mark Whittle, Ph.D., University of Cambridge and University of Virginia.  This series of 36 half hour lectures covers the physics of the origin and evolution of the universe from the big bang to the present and beyond.  Topics include how the universe started in the big bang, the cosmic microwave background and what can be learned from it, the expansion of the universe, which has been found to be accelerating rather than slowing as previously thought, the "cosmological principle" that the universe is presumed to be roughly the same everywhere on very large scales, the composition of the universe which is only about 4% known, the formation of galaxies, stars, and the chemical elements, and the perhaps surprising outcome of all this that some parts of the universe are inhabitable.  For a full description of the series, with descriptions of each lecture, visit http://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1830.  To see books this group has discussed in the past, visit http://www.sackett.net/cosmology.htm.    We will watch each 30 minute lecture and then discuss it, and will attempt to cover two lectures in each meeting.  We will meet in the Boulder Creek Meeting Room on the first floor of the main Boulder Public Library on the first and third Thursdays of each month at 7-9 PM, beginning January 6.  (On 4/7,4/21,5/5,9/15/ and 10/6, we will meet in the Arapahoe Conference Room and will not be able to view DVDs, but will discuss related topics.)  These lectures will start out slowly and move into more advanced topics, but will stay within reach of laymen with a modest backgound in science.  For more information please visit http://www.sackett.net/cosmology.htm Contact:  jeff1.grove@gmail.com 303-581-9017  Expected Schedule (may slip):  January 6 1. The Journey Ahead Cosmology takes the entire universe as its subject, not just its form, structure, and contents, but also how it was born and how it has evolved. You look at the origin of cosmology in creation stories before taking a whirlwind tour of the whole course.  2. Denizens of the Universe This lecture introduces the hierarchy of structures in the universe: from planets to stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and larger groupings of galaxies called the cosmic web. Since light travels at a finite speed, looking far away also means looking far back in time.  January 20 3. Overall Cosmic Properties The universe is lumpy at the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters. But at larger scales it seems to be smooth and similar in all directions. This property of homogeneity and isotropy is called the cosmological principle.  4. The Stuff of the Universe The most familiar constituents of the universe are atomic matter and light. Neutrinos make up another component. But by far the bulk of the universe--96%--is dark energy and dark matter. The relative amounts of these constituents have changed as the universe has expanded.  February 3 5. The Sweep of Cosmic History Take a quick trip through the history of the universe, from the big bang to a conjectured future of ever-accelerating expansion. Eight key stages are in between, including the condensation of atoms, the birth of the first stars, and the formation of galaxies.  6. Measuring Distances Astronomers use a "distance ladder" of overlapping techniques to determine distances in the universe. Triangulation works for nearby stars. For progressively farther objects, observers use pulsating stars, the rotation of galaxies, and a special class of supernova explosions.  February 17 7. Expansion and Age Measurements of the Doppler shift of galaxies in the early 20th century revealed that essentially all were moving away from us. The more distant ones are moving faster, in direct proportion to their distance. This is the famous Hubble Law, which implies an initial "big bang."  8. Distances, Appearances, and Horizons Defining distances in cosmology is tricky, since an object\'s distance continually increases with cosmic expansion. There are three important distances to consider: the emission distance, when the light set out; the current distance, when the light arrives; and the distance the light has traveled.  March 3 9. Dark Matter and Dark Energy--96%! Atomic matter comprises less than 5% of the total cosmic census. This realization came with the discovery of dark matter (23%) in the 1970s and dark energy (73%) in the late 1990s. They are "dark" because they are detectable only by their subtle gravitational effects.  10. Cosmic Geometry--Triangles in the Sky ',

    'description' => 'This Gunstwork production of the classic tale, which features exquisite puppets, expressive masks, and original choreography, ignites the imagination of young and old alike.   This dynamic solo production is a teaching story of the Abanaki, the native people of New England and southern Canada. It depicts the journey of four native New England Abenaki men as they make their way to the island where the great Gluskabe (the protector of the Abenaki) lives and the story of the wishes he bestows on them. One wishes for worldly possessions; the second yearns to be taller than all; another seeks immortality; and the fourth wishes to be a better hunter so that he may provide food for his people.   Four Wishes is for children ages 5 and up and their families.  Gunstwork makes an ancient Native American folk tale relevant for today\'s young minds. It entertains as well as raises important questions about the human forces that determine our choices and where these choices come from: whether from the heart, mind, or perhaps from greed or fear.

Donations to the Foundation will be gratefully recieved at the door.      *Â“AwesomeÂ” and Â“thrillingÂ” are two of the adjectives used to describe Nina TichmanÂ´s performances of Claude Debussy. In New York City, Frankfurt and other cities in Europe and the United States she held audiences spellbound with her traversal of the complete works in three evenings and her CDs with this repertoire have been called **"because of her exquisite touch - the most beautiful recording of the complete works".   Following her debut at the age of seventeen performing BeethovenÂ´s Â“EmperorÂ” Concerto Nina Tichman appeared in major venues including Carnegie Hall, the Cologne Philharmonie, the  Berlin Konzerthaus and the Salzburg Festspielhaus. She has worked with prominent conductors such as Moshe Atzmon, Leon Barzin, Aaron Copland, Dmitri Kitaenko and Louis Langree, appearing with the Bamberger Sinfoniker, the Symphony Orchestras of the Bayerische, Hessische and Norddeutsche radio stations, the Baltimore und St. Louis Symphonies.   Concert tours throughout North America, Asia, and Europe with appearances at major festivals such as Marlboro, Tanglewood, International Musicians Seminar at Prussia Cove, Styriarte, Frankfurt Feste, Rheingau Musikfestival, have established her as ***Â“one of the leading pianists of her generationÂ”  She is at home in repertoire ranging from Frescobaldi to composers writing today, many of whom have entrusted her with world premieres of their compositions. Her discography includes music by Bartok, Beethoven, Copland (Complete Works for Piano), Chopin, Corigliano, Faure, V.D. Kirchner, Mendelssohn, Penderecki, und Reger.  American born, Nina Tichman has been based in Europe since winning the prestigious Â“BusoniÂ” Competition. Other awards include the Mendelssohn Prize of Berlin, First Prize of the Casagrande Competition in Italy and the Prize of the Organization of American States.   In 2001 she founded the Xyrion Trio with Ida Bieler and Maria Kliegel, an ensemble that has been praised for its vital, emotional and dramatic musicmaking and whose recording of the complete Beethoven Piano Trios has been praised for its ****Â“flawless ensemble, subtle phrasing, and great rhythmic energyÂ”   Nina Tichman is a graduate of The Juilliard School, where she was awarded the Eduard-Steuermann-Prize for outstanding musical achievement. In 1993 she was appointed Professor of Piano at the Hochschule fur Musik in Cologne and she has led master classes at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, as well as at Amherst College and Princeton University   ',
