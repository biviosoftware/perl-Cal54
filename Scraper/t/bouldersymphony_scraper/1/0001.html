at First Presbyterian Church, Boulder, CO
Discovery Prelude, pre-concert conversation at 6:45PM

Join the Boulder Symphony as we embark on our first journey of exploration and discovery from post-Enlightenment Vienna to England and America. Beethoven’s First Symphony was the inception to a symphonic era that not even Mozart could have imagined. And beginning his own symphonic path, Chip Michael proves anything is possible by chasing rabbits with drums while Joseph Haydn continues to delight audiences with surprise after surprise after surprise. The Boulder Symphony is joined by the Longmont Youth Symphony as it sets its sails and shares the love of great music in Boulder for the very first time.

* Ludwig van Beethoven: Symphony no. 1
* Franz Joseph Haydn: Symphony no. 90
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Symphony no. 32 
* American Premiere of Chip Michael's ‘You Can’t Catch Rabbits with Drums’ from his First Symphony]]></description>

</ul>
<address style="text-align: left;"> </address>
<blockquote><p>All great explorers must start their journey with one step, and once that giant leap is made, it’s anybody’s guess where we are bound to end up.  It is utterly important, however that one has the tools and skills to proceed.  Beethoven arrived in Vienna in the 1790s with all the proper goods necessary to become the next Mozart or Haydn.  As Count Waldstein, one of Beethoven’s most eminent patrons once claimed, he was to receive Mozart’s spirit through Haydn’s hands (Beethoven was a recalcitrant student of Haydn).  Beethoven’s First Symphony was the beginning of the epic journey on which he would whisk western music over the next two and a half decades, culminating in his Ninth Symphony, and engendering a symphonic path on which few would tread for decades.</p>
<p>As the 19th century British Baptist preacher Charles H. Spurgeon once claimed, “you can’t catch rabbits with drums, or pigeons with plums. A thing is not good out of it’s place&#8230;”   Haydn, Beethoven and Mozart were three of perhaps thousands of classical composers vying for their compositions to be performed in Vienna, the contemporaneous musical capitol of the western world.  What keeps us talking about them today is their ability to take all the abundant raw materials of their day, melodies, harmony, rhythms, instruments, and put them in their ‘place’ by weaving into magical creations that to this day continue to transport the listener on a tremendously thrilling journey as they awaken the spirit within us.</p>
<p>For the American premiere of Chip Michael’s <em>You can’t catch rabbits with drum</em>s, from his First Symphony, the composer employs the raw materials of a whisking musical motive tossing itself around the orchestra against the percussion section.  These two elements give chase to each other throughout the work, representing the universal concept of the hunter and the hunted, the dreamer and the dream, the explorer and the discovery.</p>
<p>As what most musicologists define as an actual Overture, Mozart’s Symphony no. 32 is in one movement, and is very unique among his symphonic output in that it was most likely conceived as the humble beginning to an opera.  As an intrepid explorer himself, Mozart traveled Europe his entire life, assimilating a plethora of musical styles and idioms.  The Symphony no. 32 is one of the most delightful Italianate overtures in existence and is one of the first instances of cyclicism, where a theme, being transformed on it’s journey over multiple movements, continues to recur and by the finale gloriously returns home.</p>
<p>If Beethoven inherited one major characteristic from his teacher, Franz Joseph Haydn, it would most certainly have to be the latter’s musical humor.  Haydn was known to have instructed his musicians to walk off the stage one by one at the end of his ‘Farewell’ Symphony to send a hint to his patron Prince Esterhazy that the musicians were ready to return home to their families after a long summer leave at Eisenstadt.  Haydn is also known for throwing in a fortissimo (very loud) chord in the eighth measure of what otherwise is a very delicate slow movement in his ‘Surprise’ Symphony to rouse the audience, especially the sporadically snoozing noblemen.  While all great journeys must come to an end, Haydn’s 90th Symphony in C major questions the very nature of the actual end of a work of art.  By peppering the finale with musical deceptions, the composer’s light-hearted wit has kept audiences chuckling for over two centuries.</p></blockquote>

at Mountain View United Methodist Church Boulder
in Collaboration with Cantabile Singers Robert Farr, conductor
 
Discovery Prelude 6:45 PM - Preconcert Conversation hosted by Quentin Young

Life presents us with many trials and tribulations, and all adventures have their own seemingly insurmountable obstacles. In the wake of Beethoven's genius, even Johannes Brahms questioned his ability to create symphonic masterpieces. His First Symphony took more than 20 years to complete, and throughout he pays tribute to the master before him. Brahms also had a soft spot in his heart for Franz Schubert. Schubert’s Second Mass went on a sordid journey of its own. It was in fact stolen for some time and attributed to Robert Fuehrer, a mischievous Czech composer. Well after Schubert’s death the work was resurrected by the composer's brother Ferdinand and reconstructed into the masterpiece the Boulder Symphony will present in collaboration with the Cantabile Singers.

    * World Premiere of Chip Michael's 'Exchanging Glances'

<div>EXCHANGING GLANCES<br />
Notes by Chip Michael, Composer-in-residence</div>
<div>
<p>The inspiration behind this piece is that certain kind of magic immortalized by Rogers and Hammerstein in “Some Enchanted Evening”. Flirtations across an empty space often start with Exchanging Glances. But before we can begin the flirtation, there must be a proper mood. While the glances are harmless and fun, they quicken the pulse and come more frequent. Is there alcohol involved, or just a desire to connect? Regardless of the outcome, there is an alternate existence for those involved, not so much a stoppage of time, but moving to something outside of normalcy.</p>
<p>Written as a companion piece to Brahms&#8217; Symphony No. 1, Exchanging Glances has the same instrumentation but a very different feel. Rather than using E minor, I begin the piece in E Phrygian eventually shifting to G major and then to E Aeolian (or E minor) eventually ending in E major.</p>
<p>The structure is somewhat Sonata Allegro, somewhat Sonata Rondo. In blending modes, forms and rhythmic patterns the piece is bound together through tentative glances, as if we are never really sure whether those glances are directed at us or someone else.</p>

at First United Methodist Church, Boulder
Gregory Walker, violin

As the Boulder Symphony continues to journey to the farthest reaches of creation, we are collecting precious gems of classical music that are based in folk elements.  Both Mozart and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov traveled extensively, and absorbed musical elements of all their journeys.  The Turkish Violin concerto will be performed by Gregory Walker, who will explore all the possibilities of creation, as Mozart would have done through improvised cadenzas.  Rimsky-Korsakov, when he wrote Capriccio Espagnol, which will feature the exceptional solo talents of members of the Boulder Symphony, summed up Spanish life almost as well as Emmanuel Chabrier.  For Finlandia Jean Sibelius took a simple folk song of his native land, and by rallying the independence movement against Russia, composed the unofficial national anthem of Finland.

*Please note this concert is indeed at First United Methodist Church, and NOT at First Presbyterian Church, as was previously published on some flyers.

    * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Violin Concerto no. 5 (Turkish)
    * Ralph Vaughan Williams: English Folk Song Suite
    * Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov: Cappricio Espagnol
    * Jean Sibelius: Finlandia
    * Holiday Sing-alongs!]]></description>

<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>a World Premiere work by Ozie Cargile II (</strong></em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuAXB27aRfc" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Sneak Preview</strong></em></span></span></a><em><strong>)</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>-Beethoven Symphony no. 9 (Choral)</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Song for Humanity</strong>, commissioned from Ozie C. Cargile II by the Boulder Symphony, was written as a companion piece to the second work on our program. It is presented in three movements created to express the path of humanity on its journey toward higher consciousness notwithstanding all of our hardships. The first movement, Prayer, is a poignant oration of our struggle to experience joy in sadness; the second movement, Rebirth, mirrors the Scherzo movement of Beethoven’s 9th as an eager, and at times volatile progression toward change; the third movement, Exultation, marks the triumphant arrival of humanity to its most desirable state of existence: one of unity and freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a political activist, spiritual guru and composer, Ludwig van Beethoven set out to change the world every time he set his quill to paper. As a child of the Enlightenment, Beethoven grew up during the American and French revolutions. His first large scale work for orchestra was a cantata commemorating the death of Emperor Joseph II, who had done so much to liberalize the Austrian empire in the 1780s. Years later, Beethoven struggled to write his lone opera “Fidelio” which tells the story of the rescue of an unjustly jailed political prisoner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In his first eight symphonies, Beethoven had already stretched and broken the boundaries of the prevailing classical and symphonic style, whose (much as the contemporaneous social status quo) lifespan was nearing an end and much needed change. For his<strong> Ninth Symphony</strong>, he returned to a lengthy poem by Friedrich Schiller that Beethoven had long wanted to set to music (“Ode to Joy”). Schiller’s famous words state that in a new age the old ways will no longer divide people and that all humanity shall reclaim their long lost fraternity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beethoven’s final symphony is unprecedented not only in its length, instrumentation and most importantly, the addition of voices, but also from a formal and aesthetic standpoint. By the time we get to the final movement, Beethoven actually quotes his own previous three move- ments, systematically rejecting them one by one, until we finally come to the Panglossian words of Schiller with the addition of hundreds of voices that speak to the listener as explicitly as one could.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beethoven seems to be one of those hallmark figures throughout history who, despite all the turmoil, greed, hate, and war that has con- tinued to plague humanity, serve as a beautifully powerful reminder why we have been put on this earth: It is a profoundly simple message of love, unity and peace that Beethoven, devoutly spiritual and passionately tempestuous has sent to us, and it is really up to each of us to serve as a disciple from what can only come from “the starry tent where a loving Father must dwell.”</p>

The season of the Boulder Symphony comes to a climactic and not to be missed finale as we explore well beyond the boundaries of "classical music."  Journeying from Russia to Latin America all the way literally into the heart of India, we explore the meaning of music and the place it holds in all different cultures, and how all music has a power and utopian form that can unite those from all walks of life.  The Boulder Symphony's world premiere of Song of the Untouchable at the Kenneth King Center will be featured as the finale of Chuck Fryberger’s internationally-released 2011 documentary, Song of the Untouchable, and our audience will be featured through participation and improvisation in an evening of thrills, story telling and spiritual uplifting.

<p style="text-align: left;">The inaugural season of the Boulder Symphony comes to a climactic and not to be missed finale as we explore multiple musical journeys and exchange glances across time and distant lands. A multimedia experience fusing symphonic colors, spectacular video, and cutting-edge technology, Gregory T.S. Walker’s <strong>Song of the Untouchable for Electric Violin and Chamber Orchestra</strong> is inspired by the composer’s recent journey to the heart of Kerala, India.  The astonishing sounds of his specially-designed instrument guide the orchestra through filmmaker Chuck Fryberger’s images of exotic jungle canals and rituals, with a kaleidoscope of temple drums, Eastern melodies – and of course, audience participation.</p>
<p>Colin Thurmond describes his<strong> Concierto de Pampas for Guitar and Percucssion</strong> as &#8220;on many levels a commentary on the music to which I listen. The piece seeks to relate my experience and travels in the world and the rich diversity that coexists in the 21st century.”  Incorporating stylistic elements of composers as far flung as Alberto Ginastera, Sergei Prokofiev, Edward Elgar and Thomas Adès, the Concierto masterfully showcases a novel, imaginative and globally-influenced compositional voice of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Arturo Marquez discovered the world of the Danzon along with the seeds of his classical roots during his journeys throughout Mexico: “I discovered that the apparent lightness of the danzon hides a music full of sensuality and rigor, music that our old folks live with and haunts us today&#8230;. nostalgia and joy, a world that we can still grasp in the dance music of Veracruz and the dance halls of Mexico City.  [<strong>The Danzon no. 2</strong>]  tries to get as close as possible to the dance, to the nostalgic melodies, its monotonous rhythms, and although it desecrates its intimacy, its form and its harmonic vocabulary, it is a personal way of expressing my admiration and feelings towards real popular music”</p>
<p>Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov probably began contemplating his richly colorful and fantastical <strong>Sheherazade </strong>during his travels as a young sailor throughout the Orient and Near East.  In this Symphonic Narrative, the Sultan Shahriar, convinced of the duplicity and infidelity of all women, vowed to slay each of his wives after the first night. The Sultana Sheherazade, however, saved her life by recounting to the Sultan a succession of tales over a period of one thousand and one nights. Overcome by curiosity, the Sultan postponed the execution of the mystical and alluring Sheherazade from day to day, and ended by renouncing his murderous appetite altogether and going monogamous.</p>
