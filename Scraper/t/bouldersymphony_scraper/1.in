Beethoven\x{2019}s First Symphony was the inception to a symphonic era that not even Mozart could have imagined. And beginning his own symphonic path, Chip Michael proves anything is possible by chasing rabbits with drums while Joseph Haydn continues to delight audiences with surprise after surprise after surprise. The Boulder Symphony is joined by the Longmont Youth Symphony as it sets its sails and shares the love of great music in Boulder for the very first time. * Ludwig van Beethoven: Symphony no. 1 * Franz Joseph Haydn: Symphony no. 90 * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Symphony no. 32 * American Premiere of Chip Michael's \x{2018}You Can\x{2019}t Catch Rabbits with Drums\x{2019} from his First Symphony",

    'description' => "Life presents us with many trials and tribulations, and all adventures have their own seemingly insurmountable obstacles. In the wake of Beethoven's genius, even Johannes Brahms questioned his ability to create symphonic masterpieces. His First Symphony took more than 20 years to complete, and throughout he pays tribute to the master before him. Brahms also had a soft spot in his heart for Franz Schubert. Schubert\x{2019}s Second Mass went on a sordid journey of its own. It was in fact stolen for some time and attributed to Robert Fuehrer, a mischievous Czech composer. Well after Schubert\x{2019}s death the work was resurrected by the composer's brother Ferdinand and reconstructed into the masterpiece the Boulder Symphony will present in collaboration with the Cantabile Singers. * World Premiere of Chip Michael's 'Exchanging Glances' * Franz Schubert: Mass no. 2 * Johannes Brahms: Symphony no. 1",

    'description' => 'As the Boulder Symphony continues to journey to the farthest reaches of creation, we are collecting precious gems of classical music that are based in folk elements. Both Mozart and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov traveled extensively, and absorbed musical elements of all their journeys. The Turkish Violin concerto will be performed by Gregory Walker, who will explore all the possibilities of creation, as Mozart would have done through improvised cadenzas. Rimsky-Korsakov, when he wrote Capriccio Espagnol, which will feature the exceptional solo talents of members of the Boulder Symphony, summed up Spanish life almost as well as Emmanuel Chabrier. For Finlandia Jean Sibelius took a simple folk song of his native land, and by rallying the independence movement against Russia, composed the unofficial national anthem of Finland. *Please note this concert is indeed at First United Methodist Church, and NOT at First Presbyterian Church, as was previously published on some flyers. * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Violin Concerto no. 5 (Turkish) * Ralph Vaughan Williams: English Folk Song Suite * Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov: Cappricio Espagnol * Jean Sibelius: Finlandia * Holiday Sing-alongs!',
