			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SETH WULSIN, LALEH MEHRAN &amp; CHRISTOPHER COLEMAN<br />
Artist Talk / Public Reception<br />
Tuesday, February 22nd at 6pm<br />
at Chautauqua’s Community House<br />
900 Baseline Road, Boulder, CO 80302 <a href="http://chautauqua.com/events_map_directions.htm" target="_blank"> <strong>MAP</strong></a><br />

<p>Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art invited a group of artists to address the concerns and hopes expressed by Boulder residents regarding the way they experience diversity through a number of initiatives that would give visual representation to these concerns. The artists will spend an initial research period in Boulder to collect ideas. Returning to their studios with these impressions, they will have time to process and develop their projects, which will culminate in an exhibition at BMoCA from June 23rd through September 11th, 2011.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3447" href="http://www.bmoca.org/2011/02/the-diversity-project-introductory-artist-talks-2/artist_talks_seth1/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3447" title="ARTIST_TALKS_seth1" src="http://www.bmoca.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ARTIST_TALKS_seth1.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>CONCEPTUAL BRIEF</p>
<p>In 2007 the City of Boulder initiated its <em>Community Dialogue</em> as an opportunity for residents to express their experiences and  thoughts about life in Boulder. The published findings from this study  indicated that those who participated value what is an outdoor, active  lifestyle in a spectacular natural environment that they want to  preserve and protect. At the same time, they worry that Boulder is  becoming an elitist community, intolerant of those who are different and  with no room for people of modest or middle class means. Some of the  reasons identified by the participants for the lack of diversity in  Boulder were:</p>
<ul>
<li>the      high and escalating cost of living, particularly the cost of housing</li>
<li>the      lack of jobs available</li>
<li>an      unwelcoming environment and lack of acceptance of people of color</li>
<li>an      increasingly exclusive and elitist social atmosphere, creating an      economically and socially divided community.<a href="post.php?post=2544&amp;action=edit#_ftn1">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Taking these findings as a starting point, Boulder Museum of  Contemporary Art invited a group of artists to address the  concerns and hopes expressed by the community through a number of  initiatives that would give visual representation to the way Boulder  residents experience diversity. Initially, the artists will spend two  weeks in residency in Boulder to conduct research and collect ideas for  their respective projects. Returning to their studios with the collected  impressions, they will have time to process and develop their projects,  which will culminate in an exhibition at BMoCA from June 23 through  September 11, 2011.</p>
<p>The invited artists bring a diverse set of backgrounds and life  experiences to the project they are encouraged to draw upon when setting  to work in Boulder. Their unique points of view and distinct art making  practices can be expected to introduce unexpected nuances to their  interpretations and suggested solutions.</p>
<p>THE ARTISTS</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gustavo Artigas</span><br />
Gustavo Artigas was born in 1970 in Mexico City, where he lives and   works. He studied at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México (UNAM)   in Mexico City between 1991 and 1995. In 1996, he won the II   Installation Competition organized by the Ex-Teresa Arte Actual gallery   and was offered a residency at Project at Johannesburg, South Africa in   2001. Artigas’ work has been shown as part of the exhibition <em>Faites vos jeux! Art and Game Since Dada</em> at Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Vaduz Liechtenstein and at the Akademie   der Kunst, Berlin, Germany (2005-6); at international 04, Liverpool   Biennial, Liverpool, United Kingdom (2004); and at OUTLOOK 2003 Arena,   Society for the Advancement of Contemporary Art, Athens, Greece, among   others.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
<p>In his recent work, Artigas develops game interfaces  that invite  spectators or specific groups to interact within a given  framework,  addressing human behavior and social tension in extreme or  unusual  circumstances. For his project <em>The Rules of the Game</em>,  originally  performed along the border between San Diego, California and  Tijuana,  Mexico in 2000, he documented the activities at a &#8220;frontón&#8221;  ball court  built against the Mexican side of the border and invited two  Mexican  soccer teams and two American basketball teams to play against  each  other—all at the same time on the same court. The resulting  negotiation  of terrain and adjusting of rules, as well as the behavior  of  spectators and players were intended as a visual representation of  the  possibilities and challenges of co-existence.<em> (Gustavo Artigas&#8217; introductory talk took place at Chautauqua in January 2011. )</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seth Wulsin</span><br />
Seth Wulsin was born in 1981 in Spring Valley, New York. He studied  Drawing and Painting at Parsons The New School for Design in New York  City (1998). He briefly studied Literature and Philosophy at Yale  University, New Haven, Connecticut (2001), as well as Religion and  Politics at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island (2005). Between  2005 and 2009 he lived and worked in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since  2009, he is based in Bogota, Colombia and Brooklyn, New York. He is a  member of the art collectives Artistas en Latinoamerica, and Wubacawi,  and is currently a studio fellow at Smack Mellon, New York. His work has  been exhibited in group and solo exhibitions at DUMBO Arts Festival  2010, Brooklyn, NY; ArteBA 2010, Buenos Aires, Argentina; and at Casa  Tres Patios, Medellín, Colombia (2008).</p>
<p>In 2006 he gained international attention for his public artwork and intervention, <em>16 Tons</em>,  which documented the demolition of the infamous Caseros prison in  Buenos Aires, Argentina. Wulsin shaped pixilated portraits by hammering  out glass tiles from the façade of the notorious building, creating a  temporary monument to those who had disappeared behind its walls, as the  building was disassembled story by story.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laleh Mehran &amp; Christopher Coleman</span><br />
As the progeny of Iranian scientists, Laleh Mehran’s relationship to  religion, science, and politics is necessarily complex, and is still  more so now given a political climate in which certain views are  increasingly suspect.  Inevitably, her work is as veiled as it is  explicit, as personal as it is political, and as critical as it is  tolerant.  Mehran received her MFA in Electronic Time-Based Media from  Carnegie Mellon University, Pittburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work has been  shown individually and as part of art collectives at the Next 5 Minutes 4  Tactical Media Festival in Amsterdam, Holland; the European Media Arts  Festival in Osnabrück, Germany; Ponte Futura in Cortona, Italy;  Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams; Carnegie Museum  of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Georgia Museum of Art, University of  Georgia, Athens; and at the Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania. Mehran is Associate Professor and Graduate Director of the  Electronic Media Arts &amp; Design program at the University of Denver.</p>
<p>Chris Coleman received his BFA in his native state from West Virginia  University in 2001 and his MFA from New York State University at  Buffalo in 2003. A number of his undergraduate years were devoted to  studying Mechanical Engineering, knowledge that he brings to bear in his  installations. His work includes sculptures, performances, and videos  as well as interactive installations.  He has exhibited across Europe,  Asia, and the US, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY;  Spaces Gallery, Cleveland, OH; and FILE Sao Paulo, Brazil. Recently  Coleman’s work was featured on several giant monitors in Times Square in  New York City as the Grand Prize winner of the Babelgum Metropolis Art  Prize 2009. He is Assistant Professor in the department of Media, Film  &amp; Journalism Studies at the University of Denver.</p>
