                                            &lt;br/&gt;
                                            
                                        Metal titans ARCH ENEMY - whose dynamic cocktail of melody and aggression has earned them massive critical acclaim, a rabid worldwide fanbase and a slot on this summer's Ozzfest in the US, triumphantly return with Doomsday Machine, their most stunning and dynamic release yet.

Formed by guitarist Michael Amott after his departure from the now legendary Carcass, ARCH ENEMY first garnered praise with the metal milestones Black Earth (1997), Stigmata (1998) and Burning Bridges (1999). These albums were propelled by flawlessly technical dual guitars and a previously unheard of mixture of melody and aggression, which helped them to quickly solidify their reputation as one of the genre's elite.

However, ARCH ENEMY really began to develop their true potential once outstanding new vocalist Angela Gossow joined the fold on 2001/2002's critically acclaimed Wages of Sin album (produced by Fredrik Nordstr&amp;ouml;m and mixed by Andy Sneap), marking the first time a band of this calibre and ferocity was fronted by a woman. The album was showered with universal praise, from front cover press in worldwide metal magazines to national daily newspapers alike. Naturally, Wages Of Sin proudly claimed a position in all the end-of-the-year &amp;quot;Best Of...&amp;quot; lists, whilst the metal underground had found a new band to champion, and one that would soon show on the live stage that it had even more to offer with Angela bringing a hitherto unseen level of growling and glamour to extreme metal.

It began with a sold-out UK-tour with Opeth and festival appearances across Europe. They then headed over to North America for a 6 week tour supporting Nile, followed 2 months later by another tour in the US, this time headlining with amongst others God Forbid supporting. By the end of 2002, ARCH ENEMY were back in Europe playing their first headlining club shows in several countries before heading back to Japan to take a major slot at the Beast Feast festival with Slayer and Motorhead. On the way back from Japan they briefly stopped on US soil for a number of West Coast headline shows before Christmas, and then took to the road once again for their debut headline shows in Scandinavia at the end of January 2003.

The band's 2003 album, Anthems of Rebellion, was immediately hailed as a metal masterpiece. Produced and mixed by Andy Sneap, the record proved to be a landmark release for Century Media, as it delivered the label its then-highest first-week U.S. SoundScan sales ever, on the way to becoming one of its 10 best-selling albums of all time. Worldwide press raves continued to pour in - Anthems for example scored an unprecedented 5/5 in both Alternative Press and Kerrang!, Rock Hard Germany made it their &amp;quot;album of the month&amp;quot;, and Metal Hammer Germany stated it to be &amp;bdquo;melodic, grasping, delicately built but nevertheless a massive hit in your face.&amp;quot;

On the back of such a great response the band headed back out on the road and completed high-profile U.S. tours over the next year with Slayer, Hatebreed, Cradle Of Filth and Iron Maiden, a European Tour with Nevermore, a 2nd European headline tour as well as playing huge European festivals like Download, Rock Hard, Fields Of Rock, Graspop and Tuska, among others.

Late in 2004 ARCH ENEMY returned with the &amp;quot;Dead Eyes See No Future EP&amp;quot; - more than 30 minutes of highest quality metal, including exclusive live tracks recorded in Paris, three fantastic cover songs by Megadeth, Manowar and Carcass, as well as an enhanced version of their amazing &amp;quot;We Will Rise&amp;quot; video clip.

Now in 2005 we have Doomsday Machine and ARCH ENEMY have delivered without doubt the album of their career and are about to redefine the genre that they helped to create.

Founding guitarist and songwriter Michael Amott describes his thoughts on the group's highly anticipated new album: &amp;quot;I think all great metal needs that killer mix of classic riffs and ripping solos, something that has been a bit of a dying art recently. We are doing our best to recreate that mix on this new album, and one thing I can guarantee is that there will be tons of guitar for fans to headbang to. All in all, I am really happy with the songs and I believe we have found the right balance of melody and brutality - the Arch Enemy trademark!&amp;quot;

The album artwork was created by German multimedia artist Joachim Luetke (Dimmu Borgir, Kreator). Michael Amott comments: &amp;quot;We are all extremely pleased with the artwork for the new album! I had a few ideas initially that I discussed with Joachim on the phone, and when he started sending over images we were seriously blown away -- when you work with creative people of this calibre you just let them do what they do, so we just let him get on with it really! He's a very productive guy, very sharp. He expanded on the Doomsday Machine concept and took it to some really interesting (albeit very dark!) places. It's one of those great situations when the artwork totally works with the music.&amp;quot;

                                        Dick Dale wasn't nicknamed &amp;quot;King of the Surf Guitar&amp;quot; for nothing: he pretty much invented the style single-handedly, and no matter who copied or expanded upon his blueprint, he remained the fieriest, most technically gifted musician the genre ever produced. Dale's pioneering use of Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies (learned organically through his familial heritage) was among the first in any genre of American popular music, and predated the teaching of such &amp;quot;exotic&amp;quot; scales in guitar-shredder academies by two decades. The breakneck speed of his single-note staccato picking technique was unrivalled until it entered the repertoires of metal virtuosos like Eddie Van Halen, and his wild showmanship made an enormous impression on the young Jimi Hendrix. But those aren't the only reasons Dale was once called the father of heavy metal. Working closely with the Fender company, Dale continually pushed the limits of electric amplification technology, helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing the thick, clearly defined tones he heard in his head, at the previously undreamed-of volumes he demanded. He also pioneered the use of portable reverb effects, creating a signature sonic texture for surf instrumentals. And, if all that weren't enough, Dale managed to redefine his instrument while essentially playing it upside-down and backwards -- he switched sides in order to play left-handed, but without re-stringing it (as Hendrix later did). 

Dick Dale was born Richard Monsour in Boston in 1937; his father was Lebanese, his mother Polish. As a child, he was exposed to folk music from both cultures, which had an impact on his sense of melody and the ways string instruments could be picked. He also heard lots of big band swing, and found his first musical hero in drummer Gene Krupa, who later wound up influencing a percussive approach to guitar so intense that Dale regularly broke the heaviest-gauge strings available and ground his picks down to nothing several times in the same song. He taught himself to play country songs on the ukulele, and soon graduated to guitar, where he was also self-taught. His father encouraged him and offered career guidance, and in 1954, the family moved to Southern California. At the suggestion of a country DJ, Monsour adopted the stage name Dick Dale, and began performing in local talent shows, where his budding interest in rockabilly made him a popular act. He recorded a demo song, &amp;quot;Ooh-Whee Marie,&amp;quot; for the local Del-Fi label, which was later released as a single on his father's new Del-Tone imprint and distributed locally. During the late '50s, Dale also became an avid surfer, and soon set about finding ways to mimic the surging sounds and feelings of the sport and the ocean on his guitar. He quickly developed a highly distinctive instrumental sound, and found an enthusiastic, ready-made audience in his surfer friends. Dale began playing regular gigs at the Rendezvous Ballroom, a once-defunct concert venue near Newport Beach, with his backing band the Del-Tones; as word spread and gigs at other local halls followed, Dale became a wildly popular attraction, drawing 1,000s of fans to every performance. In September 1961, Del-Tone released Dale's single &amp;quot;Let's Go Trippin',&amp;quot; which is generally acknowledged to be the very first recorded surf instrumental. 

&amp;quot;Let's Go Trippin'&amp;quot; was a huge local hit, and even charted nationally. Dale released a few more local singles, including &amp;quot;Jungle Fever,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Miserlou,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Surf Beat,&amp;quot; and in 1962 issued his (and surf music's) first album, the groundbreaking Surfer's Choice, on Del-Tone. Surfer's Choice sold like hotcakes around Southern California, which earned Dale a contract with Capitol Records and national distribution for Surfer's Choice. Dale was featured in Life magazine in 1963, which led to appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and the Frankie/Annette film Beach Party; he also released the follow-up LP King of the Surf Guitar, and went on to issue three more albums on Capitol through 1965. During that time, he developed a close working relationship with Leo Fender, who kept engineering bigger and better sound systems in response to Dale's appetite for louder, more maniacally energetic live performances. 

Surf music became a national fad, with groups like the Beach Boys and Jan &amp;amp; Dean offering a vocal variant to complement the wave of instrumental groups, all of which were indebted in some way to Dale. But in 1964, the British Invasion stole much of surf's thunder, and Dale was dropped by Capitol in 1965. He remained a wildly popular local act, but in 1966, he was diagnosed with rectal cancer, which forced him to temporarily retire from music. He beat the disease, however, and soon began pursuing other interests: owning and caring for a variety of endangered animals, studying martial arts, designing his parents' dream house, and learning to pilot planes. In 1979, a puncture wound suffered while surfing off Newport Beach led to a pollution-related infection that nearly cost him his leg; Dale soon added environmental activist to his resum&amp;eacute;. In addition to all of that, Dale performed occasionally around Southern California throughout the '70s and '80s. 

In 1986, Dale attempted to mount a comeback. He first recorded a benefit single for the UC-Irvine Medical Center's burn unit (which had helped him recuperate from potentially serious injuries), and the following year appeared in the beach-movie sendup Back to the Beach. The soundtrack featured a duet between Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughan on the Chantays' surf staple &amp;quot;Pipeline,&amp;quot; which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental. In 1991, Dale did a guest spot on an album by the San Francisco-based Psychefunkapus, and a successful Bay Area gig got him signed with Hightone Records. The album Tribal Thunder was released in 1993, but Dale's comeback didn't get into full swing until, in 1994, &amp;quot;Miserlou&amp;quot; was chosen as the opening theme to Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster film Pulp Fiction. &amp;quot;Miserlou&amp;quot; became synonymous with Pulp Fiction's ultra-hip sense of style, and was soon licensed in countless commercials (as were several other Dale tracks). As a result, Tribal Thunder and its 1994 follow-up Unknown Territory attracted lots of attention, earning positive reviews and surprisingly strong sales. In 1996, he supported the Beggars Banquet album Calling Up Spirits by joining the normally punk- and ska-oriented Warped Tour. Adding his wife and young drum-playing son to his band, Dale refocused on touring over the next few years. He finally returned with a new CD in 2001, Spacial Disorientation, issued on the small Sin-Drome label. ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide

Cutting their respective Metal teeth at the not-so-tender ages of 12 and
14, DISSONANCE in DESIGN's (formerly Morbus Deus) core members re-invented themselves and evolved into a progressive/melodic/technical Metal wrecking ball.  The band recently added accomplished front-man Sam Johnson (ex-Sunday Massacre) who brings energy and emotion to their already concussive attack. 

Siphoning inspiration from such artists as Veil of Maya, The Faceless,
Protest the Hero, Between the Buried and Me, Within the Ruins, Animals as Leaders, and many others, DISSONANCE in DESIGN offers up an uncompromising amalgam of singular riffs and hypnotic grooves that will appeal to even the most discerning Metal palates.
Even those not-so-familiar with the Metal genre will find the music accessible, and infectious.

These young men employ an unrivaled strategy when creating their melodic mayhem: write songs that are far beyond their physical talents and capabilties, and practice/play them until they become an integral part of the DiD sonic arsenal. Technically precise execution, combined with visceral musical themes/lyrics translate to a commanding stage presence that leaves audiences transfixed... and wanting more.

Some intrinsic subject matter includes disdain for the government, self-introspection/healing, meaningful personal experiences, and the bane of worldwide religion.  Some have gone so far as to label DISSONANCE in DESIGN as &amp;quot;Inspirational Metal&amp;quot;...

Ultimately, it's all about the music itself...so there will be no acquiescing to the mundane and contrived.  Expect the unique...and the unexpected...
                                        &lt;/p&gt;

                                        Composed largely of transplants to the Seattle area, The Head and the Heart write and play songs that speak to the newness of a fresh start, of the ghosts left behind, of moving forward, all brimming with a soulfulness and hope for a better life than the one we've all been sold.

Stylistically, think a folksy Beatles or Crosby Stills Nash &amp;amp; Young with more instrumental force. Catchy piano melodies stand side by side with a tight trio of harmonies, and solid minimalist drums, groovin bass, and plenty of hand percussion and foot stomps make the live show inspiring and really goddamn fun.

The band's eponymous first album was self-released at the end of June 2010.

Rather than a &amp;quot;greatest hits&amp;quot; show, you get to experience Zeppelin as Zeppelin would have played in front of an audience.

                                        One for the Road is an HD ski film that follows some of the world's most progressive snow sports athletes as it documents their lives on the road and captures some of the most stunning riding to date. Road trips are an integral part of every adventurer's life and a conduit to define one's being. Journeys to new lands shed light on each skier's personal mission. Whether shredding with long time ski partners, or meeting a seasoned character in some far off country, wisdom is gained through these new experiences. The road trip is a metaphor for every skier's existence.&#xD;
&#xD;
Shot on location, prepare for a visually stunning voyage generated with Phantom, Red, Canon DSLR and GoPro HD footage. Join the athletes as they rock a record breaking season in Jackson Hole, immerse themselves into the culture of Japan's powder mecca Hokkaido, discover Iceland's urban side, explore the Balkan wonders of Macedonia and Montenegro, shred deep pillow lines at Baldface Lodge, uncover first descents in Pemberton, BC, and hit full throttle lines in the perfect snow and weather of Juneau, AK.&#xD;

Join the award winning producers at Teton Gravity Research as they embark on the ultimate road trip.

The road trip is a metaphor for every skier's existence.&#xD;

Shot on location, prepare for a visually stunning voyage generated with Phantom, Red, Canon DSLR and GoPro HD footage. Join the athletes as they rock a record breaking season in Jackson Hole, immerse themselves into the culture of Japan's powder mecca Hokkaido, discover Iceland's urban side, explore the Balkan wonders of Macedonia and Montenegro, shred deep pillow lines at Baldface Lodge, uncover first descents in Pemberton, BC, and hit full throttle lines in the perfect snow and weather of Juneau, AK.&#xD;

                                        Nowadays it seems that being part of a scene is the cool thing to do. It also seems that if u label ur band as metalcore, deathmetal, deathcore or any other sub genre of METAL then you'll be considered &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot;. We don't care about that stuff... all we like to do is practice, hangout in the outdoors and create music so we can destroy stages with our own brand of music that has been called &amp;quot;progess...ive&amp;quot;. Label us how u want but when it comes down to it we're just metal&amp;quot;. Those are the words of bassist Isaac Archuleta. Until Control is the bastard child of 5 dudes that love music and enjoy writing music with eachother. Their music is both brutal and melodic with touches of ambient/atmospheric elements. Upon listening to the music the listener will quickly learn that there are no boundries to this bands music which is why a very strong following is being built around the Denver area. All they can say is &amp;quot;Come to our shows and see for yourself.... u will be moved

                                            &lt;br/&gt;
                                            
                                        They‟ve blasted past the decade mark, released three acclaimed albums, and indisputably owned more than a thousand shows in over 25 countries. By now, people know: When it comes to sassy, confident, feel-good rock ‟n‟ roll Sweden‟s The Sounds are the gold standard. Even as they‟ve evolved markedly since their 2002 breakthrough debut, Living In America, the Malm&amp;ouml;-based quintet has remained true to their New Wave soul, delivering that perfect mix of sass and smarts, old and new, electric and electronic every time. Even through label shakeups and grueling tour schedules, The Sounds have been remarkably reliable, but when it came time to make their fourth album, Something To Die For, they realized it was time for a major change.
&amp;ldquo;We‟ve grown so much together and we know exactly what we want,&amp;rdquo; says Felix Rodriguez, the group‟s resident rock star, guitarist, and one of the main songwriters. &amp;ldquo;So why hire other people? This is the first time we‟ve produced an album ourselves and it was an amazing experience. We are the ones that know each other best.&amp;rdquo; While The Sounds‟ last two albums &amp;ndash; Dying To Say This To You (2006) and Crossing The Rubicon (2009) &amp;ndash; were recorded Stateside with a handful of talented producers on board (including Jeff Saltzman, Mark Saunders, James Iha, and Adam Schlesinger), Something To Die For is one hundred percent The Sounds. Not only did the band produce the album themselves, but they wrote and recorded it in their very own studio over much of 2010.
&amp;ldquo;It took discipline,&amp;rdquo; says Maja Ivarsson, the towheaded vocal vamp of the band, &amp;ldquo;but the sound we got was exactly what we‟d been looking for, and never found, at other studios. Something kinda harsh and a little cold &amp;ndash; it‟s hard to put into words, but here we were, in our own place, listening back to what we‟d recorded, and we‟re like, &amp;bdquo;This is it!‟&amp;rdquo; From opener &amp;ldquo;It‟s So Easy,&amp;rdquo; the difference is palpable. With four on the floor, the band bangs out a pulsing track that goes from ominous to blindingly bright as it approaches the transcendent &amp;ldquo;Dance With The Devil.&amp;rdquo; Here, Maja promises to &amp;ldquo;conquer our planet with dance,&amp;rdquo; and with anthemic, electro-fueled tracks like &amp;ldquo;Better Off Dead&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Yeah Yeah Yeah,&amp;rdquo; The Sounds may do just that.
&amp;ldquo;We‟ve been interested in electronic music from the beginning,&amp;rdquo; says Jesper Anderberg, keyboardist, guitarist and other main writer. &amp;ldquo;That‟s actually why a lot of us started playing music, and we wanted to emphasize that a bit more this time.&amp;rdquo; When most of the group came together in 1998 as high school students in Helsingborg, they were &amp;ldquo;club kids&amp;rdquo; says Felix. Rounded out by bassist Johan Bengtsson and drummer Fredrik Blond, The Sounds have always displayed a healthy respect for bombastic synths and propulsive beats, but on Something To Die For, the feeling is bigger, broader and bolder. Of course, the same could be said about the band‟s rocking side.
Songs like &amp;ldquo;Diana&amp;rdquo; show off The Sounds‟ undeniable penchant for playful post-punk, while &amp;ldquo;The No No Song&amp;rdquo; is pure rock-pop rave-up, with Maja spitting vitriol through a vicious sneer: &amp;ldquo;It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter to you when it felt so right /And now you lost it all, well you&amp;rsquo;re not so bright.&amp;rdquo; All of it comes together perfectly on the titular song and album centerpiece, &amp;ldquo;Something To Die For&amp;rdquo; where, over the course of five and a half minutes, Jarre-like atmosphere dissolves into a speaker-crushing thump that climaxes in a winning collision of red hot guitars and icy keyboards. &amp;ldquo;It‟s all about passion and dedication,&amp;rdquo; says Maja. &amp;ldquo;That‟s what the title means -- it‟s something to be proud of, something to stand up for ... something to die for.&amp;rdquo;
After all of this fabulous bluster, Something To Die For comes to a surprisingly quiet close with &amp;ldquo;Wish You Were Here.&amp;rdquo; Over a rolling, folksy acoustic guitar, Maja coos, &amp;ldquo;Give me your hand and we‟ll go somewhere.&amp;rdquo; The truth is, The Sounds had us in their palms from the very first note.

                                        HAVOK evolved over a number of months and was officially formed in Feb. of 2004.  Guitarist, David Sanchez had been playing with drummer, Haakon Sjoegren doing covers of all their favorite old school metal songs.  People were really enjoying what they did and gave the two musicians accolades and encouraged them to continue to perform.  Here the seeds were planted for forming a full band. With not too much actual planning they decided to start taking their play one step further and officially form a band.  
Soon after posting &amp;quot;Lead Guitarist Wanted&amp;quot; flyers around town, David got a call from one Shawn Chavez&amp;hellip; a trip to Englewood was necessary and they picked up the elusive Shawn.  Within minutes of the audition it was settled.  This was the guy!  He was a natural and so they began&amp;hellip;
What to call the band&amp;hellip; a few other names were discussed and tossed aside&amp;hellip; they went with HAVOK and off they were.
The range of influence of these musicians is expansive!!   They never cease to discover new sounds from current and past artists.  There is no sound that can't be appreciated in some way.  
HAVOK continues to play anywhere they can and are busy writing their own music.  They are influenced by a variety of artists and bands, among them:  Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Led Zepplin, Shadows Fall, Overkill, Pantera&amp;hellip;




REVIEWS


In Dave Herrera's Westword article Putting Denver on the Musical Map, he includes &amp;quot;Both Rexway and Rubber (which will play a showcase for label execs at the L.A. Knitting Factory on January 10) are among the most tuneful bands in the current batch. And they could soon have company from some new talent I've stumbled on recently: HAVOK, for instance, a group of high-schoolers who played at the Blue Mule's big mock show not long ago, and were dead-on in terms of channeling Metallica, solos and all!&amp;quot;  Performance date: Sept. 2004


Music critic, John La Briola in Denver's Westword newspaper says, &amp;quot;In the world of superheroes, HAVOK is a short-tempered X-Factor mutant with the ability to fire waves of explosive energy from his fingertips. In Denver's own underground death-core realm, the band HAVOK does something similar with guitars and amps, grinding through sheets of metal and double-kick tempos like a buzz saw. Weaned on everything from Metallica to Jimmy Page, this technically accomplished thrash outfit -- vocalist/rhythm guitarist David Sanchez, lead guitarist Shawn Chavez, bassist Marcus Corich and drummer Haakon Sjogren, who hails all the way from Drammen, Norway -- specializes in the kind of sonic doom that put the Vikings on the map before Erik the Red was teething. If a demo that includes songs about Hell and Identity Theft is any indication, HAVOK has an appetite voracious enough to eat emo kids for breakfast&amp;quot;  Performance date:  Feb. 2005


Also, Derek Rhine, Local Music Reviews writer for The Grateful Web wrote:&amp;quot;The show opened up with Havok. 4 kids 16 to 19 years old. These guys just blew me away! You don't see this type of powerful stage presence from kids this young. They took the stage and dived straight into a fast, tight and powerful set. They wasted no time in getting the crowd into their old school styled metal. These guys remind me of early Exodus and Slayer with a touch of Metallica thrown on top just for kicks. Crunching guitar riffs and screaming lyrics made me want to dive right into the pit, and if I weren't afraid of getting my teeth knocked out like one fan did that night, I might have! (The kid who got his tooth knocked out was happy about it! Said it was an awesome show! He stayed in the pit from Havok on through the end of the show)  Havok shows more than a promise, if they keep this type of show up they WILL be signed and they will be big! These kids got all the makings of a great metal band and I would LOVE to see them play again anytime! Hey Havok! You just made a new fan!&amp;quot;  Performance date:  Oct. 2005

                                        MarchFourth is a date, a command, and a band. Imagine Duke Ellington meets Sgt. Pepper in an international big-top Fantasia. Imagine a 1920's speakeasy where Mr. Bungle meets the Shogun Warriors in a PG Clockwork Orange. Imagine running into this giant spectacle marching through a festival, down a street, or onto stage. The impact is immediate and infectious!&#xD;
&#xD;
MarchFourth Marching Band is a mobile big band spectacular, consisting of saxophones, trombones, trumpets and a drum/percussion corps, anchored by electric bass (battery powered). M4 &amp;quot;rocks&amp;quot; with the best of them, entertaining the audience with an over-the-top explosion of performance and charisma. The sound is huge, melodic, and dynamic, taking audiences on a musical journey around the globe. MarchFourth writes and performs its own material, and also draws inspiration from an eclectic range of worldwide influences, such as Eastern European Gypsy Brass, Samba, Funk, Afro-Beat, Big-Band, Jazz, and Rock music, as well as television, film, circus, and Vaudeville.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stilt-walkers, dancing girls, flag twirlers, clown antics, and acrobatics are just some of the things you'll see accompanying this eclectic big band. MarchFourth Marching Band's stilt-walkers are world-class, performing acrobatics, dance routines, and even fire dancing on stilts&amp;mdash;all in fanciful costumes. The other dancing beauties can fill the stage with mesmerizing original dance routines or spread out into the audience and get everybody dancing. The musical quality, the energy of the band, and the spectacle of the dancers all combine to create an original performance that appeals to even the biggest cynics.&#xD;
&#xD;
To MarchFourth Marching Band, art is life. Aside from being performers, the members of MarchFourth are also full- or part-time artists, designers, and craftspeople. All their drum harnesses (welded from recycled bicycle parts), stilts, costumes, merchandise, audio, and visual propaganda are designed and produced by members of the band.&#xD;
&#xD;
The scope of appeal is almost universal: MarchFourth can fit in (and stand out!) at everything from weddings and school assembly concerts, to nationally known music festivals and top-level sporting events.

Everyone comes from somewhere, but some people wear the cities they're from like badges of honour. Drop the Lime is Luca Venezia, one of those people whose identity is intrinsically connected to his hometown &amp;ndash; New York City.

And while many have only just heard of the magic of Drop The Lime, Luca has been honing his craft for years. From humble beginnings as a choirboy to a childhood obsession with 50s rock'n'roll, the 25 year old has been experimenting with sound for years via the underground electronic scene of Kid 606's TigerBeat6 label, Mad Decent and French label Institubes (under his alter ego &amp;quot;Curses!&amp;quot;).

He also runs Trouble &amp;amp; Bass, an influential New York club night and label since 2006. The Trouble &amp;amp; Bass crew are the DJs who are defining a new New York sound.
                                        &lt;/p&gt;

                                        Skyfox is a band that you should never ever take for granted or underestimate. In order for any band to make it they need to spend years of hard work and dedication perfecting themselves and what they do into a rock solid piece of musical machinery. Once the machinery is built the quest for constant improvement must continue. This is exactly how Skyfox operates. Don't ever think because these guys are some of the most fun loving and down to Earth guys offstage that they don't deliver the definitive pop-punk experience on stage. With years of experience in the rock n roll trenches behind them Skyfox knows how to craft each note into a hook and each hook into a song and each song into a live performance that is as tight and dynamic as a band can deliver. Like the war plane they are named after Skyfox can &amp;quot;Bring the rain!&amp;quot; and their very large and loyal fan base thank them for it.

                                        Anesthesia BLVD was started in January 2009 by Conor Culver, Tyler Duffus and Mark Black. After 2 months of playing together the band started doing shows around the Denver and Aurora areas, soon after they recorded a homemade 6 track E.P. that they would give away for free at shows. After spending the rest of the year working their way up through the bars to bigger venues around town and a lot of writing the band thought it was time to record a full length album. Recording started January 2010 but in February they were contacted by producer Anthony Lopardo who wanted the band to fly out to New York and record it with him. In November they did just that. They spent the last couple weeks of the month recording at Killingworth Recordings in Farming Dale, Long Island. In March 2011 the 10 track self-titled album was released digitally on iTunes, Rhapsody, Napster and Amazon. While on their online store CDs and a 13 track digital deluxe edition was made available. In August 2011 the band signed up with Dynasty Records to release the album in record stores throughout America and Canada. The album was released September 13th  2011.

                                        This is the story of the Phenomenon known as the GENITORTURERS whose audio-visual exploits have earned them the title as &amp;quot; THE WORLDS SEXIEST ROCK BAND&amp;quot;!

The players:

GEN: Vocals, Ringleader, Instigator of Official Debauchery

Evil &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; David Vincent: Bass guitar, Upright bass

Bizz: Guitar

Originating in Orlando Florida, Gen gave birth to the concept of Genitorturers while in college studying pre-med. 

The Genitorturers cut their teeth, honing their music and live show initially in the early 90's Florida &amp;quot;Hardcore&amp;quot; music scene. What emerged would be a band that would go beyond shaking up the house that &amp;quot;Mickey&amp;quot; built and extend to paving the way and breaking ground for performance based music artists thereafter worldwide.

In 1993 the band caught the ear of Miles Copeland owner of IRS records, who had discovered and created careers for acts like REM, GoGo's, The Bangles, Concrete Blond and STING. He was drawn to the band whose live shows were becoming infamous regionally and quickly sent his assistant Nick Turner ( former drummer for Lords of the New Church) to Florida to check out the band. Upon witnessing the power of the bands live show which included a music style which crossed over from hardcore punk into metal with industrial electronic elements, the band was offered a record contract and set out to record &amp;quot;120 Days of Genitorture&amp;quot;.

Since their 1993 IRS Records debut release of &amp;quot;120 Days of Genitorture&amp;quot;, the band has been covered by many high profile media outlets. Television coverage has included features on VHI, Fox News, Hard Copy, HBO's Real Sex and Playboy TV's &amp;quot;SEXCETERA&amp;quot;.

With over 5,000 pages of articles, recent 2004 printmedia coverage has included a feature in Gene Simmons &amp;quot;Tongue&amp;quot; magazine and 12 pages in the May 2004 issue of Hustler magazine.. the ONLY multi-page spread EVER with a rock band.

In addition, extensive touring in the U.S., Europe and JAPAN have garnered them a devoted fan base worldwide, a growing number of whom travel to repeat shows calling themselves &amp;quot;GENHEADS&amp;quot; or fight tooth and nail when the band auctions off their annual &amp;quot;EVENING OF TORTURE&amp;quot; on EBAY. Lead singer Gen has even been the subject of a British release feature film &amp;quot;Preaching to the Perverted&amp;quot; a fictional account exploring her life and exploits.

Today GENITORTURERS have succeeded in making believers of even the stodgiest music critics who prior to witnessing them live had all but written them off as some kind of gimmick....&amp;quot;Yes, they have their schtick......but can they play? You betcha!. Their hard driving yet brutally sexy rock and roll sucks you in.. and once you are there you are hooked!

The bands most recent ep release &amp;quot;Flesh is the Law &amp;quot; is sure to satisfy any aural fixation and includes the track &amp;quot;Lecher Bitch&amp;quot; which was just featured in the November 2004 videogame release &amp;quot;Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines&amp;quot;

Earlier releases have included the cd &amp;quot; Machine Love&amp;quot; which includes an incredible remake of the Divinyl's hit &amp;quot;Touch Myself&amp;quot; produced by Dave Ogilvie(Skinny Puppy, NIN) and Rob Zombie producer Scott Humphrey .

                                        Guitarist-singer Tab Benoit is the real deal. Born and raised on the Louisiana bayou, this self-proclaimed &amp;quot;new kid from the old school&amp;quot; has been the standard bearer for a new generation of Cajun blues musicians &amp;ndash; a traditionalist and an innovator at the same time, grafting elements of rock and soul to the indigenous sounds of the bayou. And if dedicating his life to his musical roots weren't enough, Benoit has also been a tireless crusader in recent years &amp;ndash; prior to the devastation of hurricane Katrina but even more so since &amp;ndash; for the preservation of the rapidly vanishing wetlands of his native region.

                                        The music of Pink Floyd continues to be a top seller today, with classic albums like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall appealing to new generations decades after their release. &amp;quot;Wish We Were Floyd&amp;quot; showcases the total immersive experience of a live Pink Floyd show, entertaining the casual Floyd listeners as well as the hardcore fan. Those familiar with Pink Floyd's radio hits will recognize much of the material. Hardcore fans will find the attention to detail worthy of respect, while being treated to some deeper cuts from Floyd's extensive repertoire. 

In 2006 &amp;quot;Wish We Were Floyd&amp;quot; debuted at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre.  Denver's own Savage Henry was invited to put together a Pink Floyd tribute in conjunction with the annual Film on the Rocks series, and their showing of &amp;quot;Pink Floyd's The Wall&amp;quot;. Savage Henry responded with a performance that boasted over 200 hours of rehearsal and featured 15 guest musicians from some of the regions most noted bands.

From those auspicious beginnings, Wish we Were Floyd has continued to perfect and refine their Floyd tribute. Today, the core &amp;quot;Wish We Were Floyd&amp;quot; line-up includes members of Savage Henry, The Fong Jones Band, &amp;amp; The Jars.  Featuring seven accomplished musicians and a multimedia blitz of lights and video, this show is designed to appeal to all ages and audience.


&amp;quot;Savage Henry's tribute to Pink Floyd sent chills over me -hands down the best I have ever seen. The entire band adopted the persona, the vibe, as well as the visuals that blew Red Rocks away&amp;quot;
