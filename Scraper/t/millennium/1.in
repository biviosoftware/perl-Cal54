    'description' => 'What exactly is Reckless Red? It began as an online conversation between singer CJ Nicolai and drummer John Ware about art and gratification. And it grew into grew into a band that plays loose and rude, expecting the unexpected from each other. That band is Reckless Red -- home for CJ\'s throaty, un-girly pipes that wreck all your "girl singer" notions ...and also home for a handful of players from the heartland and both coasts who bring together all the right spices of blues and country. The band cooks up a swampy, muscle-bound sound that\'s brewed from a lifetime of experience in the studio, on giant stages, and in backwoods dives. The resulting Reckless Red soup is anything but narrow -- and it\'s made from bluesy stock that\'s rich in the roots of Americana and never far from a raw, gritty edge.',

    'description' => 'UABRS is an acclaimed U2 tribute band that passionately recreates authentic U2 concerts. Covering the War tour in 1983 to present day, each show has amazed fans with their ability to recreate famous U2 shows and has solidified their reputation for sold out venues - including the world-famous Red Rocks! Billy Bunting had been a rabid U2 fan since he saw the band in New Haven, CT in 1981. Billy never forgot Bono climbing up to the balcony of this old theatre singing "Sunday Bloody Sunday" at the top of his lungs and thought, "I want to do that!" From that point forward, Billy immersed himself in U2 music and that event helped shape Billy as a singer. After 20+ years as professional musicians, Billy and Jerry Bousquet returned to their roots and formed UABRS. UABRS got its start by recreating the legendary 1983 "Live at Red Rocks" concert on New Year\'s Eve 2005 at a sold out show at the Paramount Theater in Denver, CO. It went over huge!!! The fans were taken back to that foggy June 5th evening and ended the night by singing the refrain from "40" as the band left the stage. It was EXACTLY like Red Rocks and Billy "Bono", Ted "The Tedge", Todd "Adam" and Jerry "Larry" have never looked back -- providing fans the best U2 experience this side of Dublin!! Not only does UABRS play and sound like U2, their amazing attention to detail creates a visual experience that the most ardent U2 fan would recognize. UABRS makes every effort to replicate wardrobe, stage props, video/audio choreography, instruments and equipment from many famous U2 concerts around the world.',
