	     What exactly is Reckless Red? It began as an online conversation between singer CJ Nicolai and drummer John Ware about art and gratification. And it grew into grew into a band that plays loose and rude, expecting the unexpected from each other. That band is Reckless Red -- home for CJ's throaty, un-girly pipes that wreck all your "girl singer" notions ...and also home for a handful of players from the heartland and both coasts who bring together all the right spices of blues and country. The band cooks up a swampy, muscle-bound sound that's brewed from a lifetime of experience in the studio, on giant stages, and in backwoods dives. The resulting Reckless Red soup is anything but narrow -- and it's made from bluesy stock that's rich in the roots of Americana and never far from a raw, gritty edge.

But his most impressive undertaking to date may be his solo effort, an eclectic exploration of dub, jazz, funk, hip-hop and soul called the Byron Shaw Projex.  Joined by some of Denver's finest, the Byron Shaw Projex is a dervish of soul-shaking grooves; a funk junket through years and genres that drifts past only once in a lapis moon... all aboard!  Byron says of his band, "It's kinda like Portishead meets Rick James at a Tito Puente concert with Bob Marley's sons throwing the after party!"

	     UABRS is an acclaimed U2 tribute band that passionately recreates authentic U2 concerts. Covering the War tour in 1983 to present day, each show has amazed fans with their ability to recreate famous U2 shows and has solidified their reputation for sold out venues - 
including the world-famous Red Rocks! Billy Bunting had been a rabid U2 fan since he saw the band in New Haven, CT in 1981. Billy never forgot Bono climbing up to the balcony of this old theatre singing "Sunday Bloody Sunday" at the top of his lungs and thought, "I want to do that!" From that point forward, Billy immersed himself in U2 music and that event helped shape Billy as a singer. After 20+ years as professional musicians, Billy and Jerry Bousquet returned to their roots and formed UABRS. UABRS got its start by recreating the legendary 1983 "Live at Red Rocks" concert on New Year's Eve 2005 at a sold out show at the Paramount Theater in Denver, CO. It went over huge!!! The fans were taken back to that foggy June 5th evening and ended the night by singing the refrain from "40" as the band left the stage. It was EXACTLY like Red Rocks and Billy "Bono", Ted "The Tedge", Todd "Adam" and Jerry "Larry" have never looked back -- providing fans the best U2 experience this side of Dublin!! Not only does UABRS play and sound like U2, their amazing attention to detail creates a visual experience that the most ardent U2 fan would recognize. UABRS makes every effort to replicate wardrobe, stage props, video/audio choreography, instruments and equipment from many famous U2 concerts around the world.

	     Judge Roughneck is one of Colorado's premier bands! Having a loyal nationwide fan base, and repeatedly voted Denver's best ska/reggae act, Judge Roughneck has gained both commercial success and critical acclaim. Due to the band's widespread appeal, they have been asked to perform once again at this year's Reggae on the Rocks Festival at Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheater. Judge Roughneck routinely draws hundreds of fans to its shows across Colorado, including back-to back- to-back sellout shows at Herman's Hideaway in Denver, capacity 500. The band has also been played on numerous Denver area commercial radio stations including KBCO, KTCL, KBPI and Alice 106. Judge Roughneck's unique brand of pop-reggae pays tribute to both the early '80's British 2-Tone movement and the original jazz laced ska of Jamaica, while infusing a generous dose of soul and R&B. The result is a unique, high-energy dance sound that entertains a wide audience.
