    'description' => 'Alice 105.9, Westword and Twist & Shout! present JOSHUA RADIN Cary Brothers & Laura Jansen Though Joshua Radin enjoyed singing during his childhood, the Cleveland native never intended to be a professional musician. Instead, he studied drawing and painting at Northwestern University, following his college years with stints as an art teacher, screenwriter, and art gallery employee. Eventually, Radin took a stab at songwriting and played one of his earliest compositions, "Winter," for his friend Zach Braff. The burgeoning actor/director took an immediate liking to the song, and "Winter" eventually found its way onto Braff\'s hit television show Scrubs in early 2004. After fans began to request more of his music, Radin decided to pursue a songwriting career and signed with Columbia Records, which issued his debut album, We Were Here, in 2006. Radin relocated to Los Angeles and aligned himself with the Hotel Cafe, a unique Hollywood venue specializing in performances by singer/songwriters. He soon found himself playing national tour dates with a number of Hotel Cafe regulars, including Ingrid Michaelson, Sara Bareilles, and Meiko. Meanwhile, he issued a pair of digital EPs via iTunes while readying the release of his sophomore album, Simple Times, which arrived in late 2008. The album was released in the U.K. two years later. Meanwhile, Radin placated his American fans by issuing a short EP, Songs Under a Streetlight, and putting the finishing touches on The Rock and the Tide, which appeared in October 2010.',

    'description' => '97.3 KBCO, Boulder Weekly, Twist & Shout! and Rock The Earth! Present MEDESKI MARTIN & WOOD Wide open: That\'s the phrase John Medeski uses to describe his bandmates\' musical sensibilities, the attitude he seeks in himself, and the spirit of musical adventure that Medeski Martin & Wood have pursued for two decades. The trio\'s amalgam of jazz, funk, "avant-noise" and a million other musical currents and impulses is nearly impossible to classify, which is just how they like it. Medeski\'s keyboard excursions, Chris Wood\'s hard-charging bass lines and Billy Martin\'s supple, danceable beats have come to resemble a single organism, moving gracefully between genre-defying compositions and expansive improvisation atop a relentless groove. Though the "jazz spirit," as they like to call it, has been ever-present in their sonic voyages, Medeski Martin & Wood have won over a substantial audience that rarely responds to instrumental music, let alone a guitar-less trinity purveying an unholy blend of Jimmy Smith, Gyorgy Ligeti and the Art Ensemble of Chicago. In fact, their club and festival appearances are packed with alternative-rock lovers as well as jam-band aficionados and jazz heads. "I blame Billy for that," Medeski muses, hazarding that the drummer\'s body-moving beats tend to disarm even the most pop-minded listeners. "Once they feel the groove he\'s playing, I can get in there and infect their minds much more easily - and Chris can lay it down to keep them from losing it." Their reflections on having reached the extraordinary milestone of playing together for some 20 years? "We\'re old motherfuckers, man," Medeski replies with a laugh, adding, "We\'re in a really good place. We\'ve been writing a lot of new music. We always want to create a certain vibration in the evening - if we\'re doing something new and feeling the excitement, that\'ll do it."',

    'description' => '97.3 KBCO, Daily Camera and Twist & Shout! Present RANDY NEWMAN Randy Newman has long been one of the most musically and lyrically ambitious singer-songwriters ever to be at play in the fields of popular music. Born on November 28, 1943 to a renowned musical family, by seventeen Newman was a working songwriter. In 1968 he debuted with Randy Newman, and before long an unusually wide range of artists were recording his songs. Critics lauded the musical depth, edge and literary quality of his lyrics as the 70\'s brought 12 Songs, Live, the classic Sail Away and brilliant and controversial Good Old Boys. Little Criminal caught the public\'s ear with the hit "Short People". Born Again followed. In the Eighties, Newman\'s foray into film composing earned him his first two of sixteen Oscar nominations. Trouble In Paradise and the Grammy-winning score for The Natural followed. Next, Land of Dreams was considered another breakthrough work. In the Nineties, Newman earned an Emmy and several more Grammys for work on films like Toy Story, James and the Giant Peach, Bug\'s Life and Toy Story 2. Newman also tickled his adult audience with his darkly hilarious take on Faust. The four-CD compilation: Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman and Bad Love followed, and in 2002, Newman won his first Oscar for Best Original Song for Monsters Inc. He has also earned 5 Grammy awards and 2 Emmy awards throughout his career. The Randy Newman Songbook, Vol. I (2003), his first effort for Nonesuch, introduces powerful new solo versions of early classics and recent gems alike. The eighteen songs are an intimate and powerful reminder of the enduring work that Newman has established. In 2008 he released Harps and Angels; for Nonesuch records. His first collection of new songs since 2009\'s Bad Love. Most recently, Newman wrote the songs and score for Disney\'s The Princess and the Frog as well as Toy Story 3. He has earned two more Academy Award nominations(19 total) in the Best Original Song category for Almost There and Down In New Orleans. On June 2nd 2010 Newman received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.',

    'description' => 'The Daily Camera & KUVO Present STANLEY CLARKE BAND & VICTOR WOOTEN BAND STANLEY CLARKE BAND Exploding into the jazz world in 1971, Stanley was a lanky teenager from the Philadelphia Academy of Music. He arrived in New York City and immediately landed jobs with famous bandleaders such as: Horace Silver, Art Blakey, Dexter Gordon, Joe Henderson, Pharaoh Saunders, Gil Evans, Stan Getz, and a budding young pianist composer named Chick Corea. All of these musicians recognized immediately the ferocious dexterity and complete musicality the young Clarke possessed on the acoustic bass. Not only was he expert at crafting bass lines and functioning as a timekeeper in the bass\' traditional role, Stanley also possessed a sense of lyricism and melody gained from his bass heroes Charles Mingus, Scott LaFaro, and others, including non-bass players like John Coltrane. Clarke recognized the opportunity to propel the bass into a viable melodic soloist role and was uniquely qualified to do just that. Stanley Clarke became the first bassist in history to headline tours, selling out shows worldwide, and have his albums certified gold. The word "legend" was used to describe Stanley by the time he was 25 years old. In 1997 Epic/Sony released: By this tender young age, Stanley was already a celebrated pioneer in fusion jazz music. He was also the first bassist in history to double on acoustic and electric bass with equal virtuosity, power, and fire. His artistry has spanned classical, jazz, R&B and pop idioms. He has already succeeded in a multitude of diverse careers, any one of which would be satisfactory to anyone else. Yet he still pushes on, as invigorated and as passionate about music as that teenage prodigy from Philadelphia with a dream. The Biography of this incredible musician, like Stanley himself, is a continuing work in process. VICTOR WOOTEN He is an innovator, composer, arranger, lecturer, producer, vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist. He is a skilled naturalist and teacher, a published author, a magician, husband and father of four, and a five-time Grammy award winner. But those gifts only begin to tell the tale of this Tennessee titan. Victor, known for his solo recordings and tours, and as a member of the Grammy-winning super group, Bela Fleck & The Flecktones, has won most every major award given to a bass guitarist. He was voted Bassist of the year by Bass Player Magazine three times and is the only person to have won the award more than once. Continuing to grow as a person, artist, and teacher, Victor Wooten is always willing to share his gifts with all who desire to learn. Offering CDs, DVDs, lectures, workshops, and camps, as well as his groundbreaking novel The Music Lesson (Berklee Publishing - a division of the Penguin Group) Victor Lemonte Wooten is guaranteed to remain a positive force in the music industry.',

    'description' => 'Boulder Weekly & KGNU Present ACOUSTIC AFRICA Ft. Habib Koite, Oliver Mtukudzi and Afel Bocoum The second installment of Acoustic Africa\'s exhilarating musical journey focuses on the richness of the African guitar tradition. The Acoustic Africa tour features Habib Koite, the Malian superstar whose exciting concerts have endeared him to audiences worldwide, Oliver Mtukudzi, the best-selling artist in his home country of Zimbabwe, and, a guitarist, singer, and composer from Mali whose songs evoke the Afel Bocoum evolution of traditional Malian society. The three artists, backed by a traditional African band, unite in song in a collaborative performance that honors their African heritage while simultaneously pushes contemporary musical boundaries. One of Africa\'s most exciting performers, Habib Koite plays music that reflects the diverse musical traditions of his Malian homeland. Accompanied by his band Bamada, Koite has released a number of successful and critically acclaimed albums and has appeared on the The Late Show with David Letterman and in major magazines such as People and Rolling Stone. Over the past 10 years, Habib and his band have performed over 600 concerts for adoring audiences in far-flung locations such as Japan, Australia, Brazil and Kazakhstan. With their engaging stage presence and expert musicianship, Habib Koite and Bamada always put on a show to remember. Lovingly called "Tuku" for short, Oliver Mtukudzi began recording in the mid-1970s as a member of Wagon Wheels, a band that also featured Thomas Mapfumo. After Wagon Wheels rolled to fame in Southern Africa, Tuku formed Black Spirits, the band that has backed him throughout his career. Mtukudzi has been heavily influenced by chimurenga, the genre pioneered by Mapfumo that is inspired by the hypnotic rhythms of the mbira (thumb piano). His music also incorporates pop influences, South African mbaqanga, the energetic Zimbabwean pop style JIT, and the traditional kateke drumming of his clan, the Korekore. While Tuku\'s music is undeniably contagious, it is his lyrics that have captured the hearts of his people. The words to his songs invariably deal with social and economic issues. One of Tuku\'s biggest fans is Bonnie Raitt, who has not only called Oliver "a treasure", but has also used his music as inspiration for the song "One Belief Away" on her album Fundamental. Afel Bocoum began his music career with his uncle Ali Farka Toure, in his group Asco, a collaboration which lasted some thirty years. In the 1980s, he founded his own group, which he named Alkibar, in which he plays the guitar, composes, and sings. Bocoum sings mainly in Sonrai, his mother tongue, but also in Tamashek, the language of the Tuareg, and in Bambara. In spite of his growing success, Bocoum remains gentle and unassuming, modestly directing the energy this recognition brings him towards the welfare of his people and the inspiration they give to his music. In the dancing melodies of the river and the palpitating rhythm of the hard desert wind, there is no doubt that the heritage of Ali Farka Toure is in good hands. With remarkable subtlety and a sure talent, Afel Bocoum has proved that he is a true "Messenger of the great river", and it\'s certain he will actively contribute to keeping Malian music at the forefront of the international scene.',

    'description' => 'Westword and Twist & Shout Present BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE w/ Special Guests So yeah, it\'s been five years since the last Broken Social Scene album, but it also hasn\'t. In the time that\'s elapsed since the release of 2005\'s self-titled opus, we were more than tided over by the 2007 release of founding member Kevin Drew\'s solos album, "Spirit If...," followed a few months later by co-founder Brendan Canning\'s own solo set, "Something for All of Us" - both of which were released under the "Broken Social Scene Presents" banner, both of which were supported by tours that featured career-spanning set lists, and both of which featured pretty much the same group of players you hear on this new BSS release, "Forgiveness Rock Record." In hindsight, Broken Social Scene\'s period of supposed inactivity was arguably their most productive stretch yet-yet another contradiction that makes up the byzantine BSS myth. So even now-some 10 years after Drew and Canning first started laying down ambient instrumentals in a Toronto basement for their debut BSS release "Feel Good Lost"-that eternal question still lingers: what exactly makes a Broken Social Scene album a Broken Social Scene album? For some, it\'s that omnipresent element of randomness and chaos-which is a fine theory and all, except "Forgiveness Rock Record" was approached on arguably the most stable footing the band has ever had, built as it was around the core 2007-08 touring line-up of Drew, Canning, drummer Justin Peroff and guitarists, Andrew Wehiteman, Charles Spearin and Sam Goldberg. For others, Broken Social Scene is defined by trippy, triple-guitar jams that slowly erupt into moments of brass-blasted rapture-but while that observation may be supported by "Forgiveness Rock Record\'s" epic opener "World Sick," it doesn\'t explain the manic, string-stabbed berserker pop of "Chase Scene," or the breezy space-age-bachelor-pad swing of "Art House Director." And then there are those who say the Broken Social Scene sound is the result of producer Dave Newfeld\'s psychedelic studio magic; however, for "Forgiveness Rock Record," the band decamped to Soma Studios in Chicago and Giant Studio in Toronto to work with one of their heroes, Tortoise/Sea and Cake drummer John McEnteire, who punched holes in the textural haze and coaxed the band into delivering the most assertive, forthright performances to date. For a band that once sang "its all gonna break" like it was a self-fulfilling prophecy, Broken Social Scene has never sounded more together.',

    'description' => 'KGNU & Boulder Weekly present The Further Adventures of THE SAW DOCTORS AM Taxi The Saw Doctors are known in Ireland for ridiculously catchy songs and for rocking the road week after week from Galway to Melbourne--and, come March 2011, from New York to Las Vegas. They\'ve hopped up countless crowds, including at two inaugurations of Maryland governor Martin O\'Malley, with upbeat anthems to everyday people. A fun-loving reputation precedes the band thanks to their zany hit "I Useta Lover" or the recent sneak Irish radio chart-topper, "Red Cortina A Cappella." But it belies a more reflective side with deep roots, a side sometimes forgotten even by the group\'s biggest fans. Bittersweet portraits of everyday people and the landscape that surrounds them are what the band does best. The Saw Doctors have a Springsteen-like ability to get at the poignant perspectives of ordinary folks: the lovesick pub regular, the guys on the corner, the wise old woman who greeted all comers with a slice of bread and butter. This ability flows from the roving group\'s strong ties to Tuam--and to the lives and stories of the people in it. It\'s a town of wits and eccentrics, folks like cartoon artist Squigley McHugh, who humorously sketched the Saw Doctors as superheroes for their stage backdrop. Tuam is known for its gregarious, sometimes overly curious conversationalists. It\'s a place where people still pop down to the pub in the afternoon, looking for a pint and a good gossip. But don\'t be surprised if you can\'t make out a word: Tuam, explains Moran, has its own secret code, a slang and a love of peculiar turns of phrase incomprehensible to outsiders. "In Tuam, there\'s a great interest in language and words. A lot of the Travellers, itinerant Irish traders and tin-smiths, settled around Tuam and had their own language they used while trading. We\'ve adopted it as core citizens of the town." Tuam\'s citizens relish slang and constantly invent new words. Expressions like "Well-Byes," the greeting of choice among young guys in jogging suits, speak volumes: "you know where you are and you\'re from Tuam," Moran says. Soccer players use local slang when playing against other towns to keep their next moves under wraps (as the band recounts in "All the Way from Tuam"). Yet words, like the band itself, have a far more winsome side, connecting people with their history and the land. In "Friday Town," the Anglicized place-names in the chorus hint at a lost Irish past, as Moran sings of people long gone, either overseas to America or to their graves. "When you study the names in Irish, they carry meanings, some feature in the landscape or the memory of something that happened there," Moran notes. "But all these lovely meanings have been lost. We\'re trying to celebrate them, as well as the people who left forever for the States, on an epic, courageous journey." More introspective moments still ring with bright guitars, catchy melodies, and upbeat energy, which make The Saw Doctors shows fun, even at their deepest. Sometimes when playing live around Ireland, the exuberant singing from the audience has nearly drowned out the band. The group loves to drop their vocals out altogether, providing only instrumental accompaniment for the chorus of enthusiastic fans, who seem to know every song by heart. The down-to-earth feel--and the Tuam wit--have universal appeal. "People sometimes say that a song about Tuam or Galway or Ireland won\'t matter to people abroad. That\'s like telling Bruce Springsteen that he is wasting his time writing about the Jersey Shore," Moran reflects. "Songs are about sharing feelings and emotions and ideas. If you have ideas and emotions that people can relate to, then it works no matter where you play."',

    'description' => '97.3 KBCO & Daily Camera Present JOHN PRINE with Sarah Jarosz The first time he got onstage to perform - at a Chicago open mic night -there was absolute silence. Here comes a guy nobody had ever seen, a mailman from nearby Maywood, and the very first songs he ever sings are miracles, songs like "Hello In There" and "Angel from Montgomery." But this stunned silence spelled disaster to Prine. "They just sat there," he said. "They didn\'t even applaud, they just looked at me. I thought, `Uh oh. This is pretty bad.\' I started shuffling my feet and looking around. And then they started applauding and it was a really great feeling. It was like I found out all of a sudden that I could communicate deep feelings and emotions. And to find that out all at once was amazing." That one night changed his life. The club-owner offered him a gig, and from that moment on he quickly became one of Chicago\'s most beloved local heroes, a guy who would honor the Windy City with as much love and grace as Studs Terkel and Carl Sandburg. Prine soon befriended another local hero, Steve Goodman, and with Goodman he met the world. Kris Kristofferson heard his songs, helped him land a record deal, and soon everyone knew what Chicago already did, that Prine was the real deal. From that first album on, he came known as a genuine "songwriter\'s songwriter," one of the rare ones who writes the songs other songwriters would sell their souls for. Evidence of this is the long list of songwriters who have recorded his songs, including Johnny Cash, Bonnie Raitt, the Everly Brothers, John Denver, Kris Kristofferson, Carly Simon, Ben Harper, Joan Baez, and many others. Even Bob Dylan was stunned. "His stuff is pure Proustian existentialism," said Bob Dylan. . "He\'s so good," said Kristofferson, "we\'re gonna have to break his fingers." Dylan and the rest were simply recognizing that which we have all come to know, that Prine\'s songs are so hauntingly evocative of the laughter and tears inherent in the human condition, so purely precise and finely etched, that lines from them linger in our hearts and minds like dreams, separate from the songs. There\'s the rodeo poster from "Angel from Montgomery," the hole in daddy\'s arm and the broken radio (from "Sam Stone"), the old trees that just grow stronger (from "Hello In There.") The kinds of lines you carry around in your pocket, knowing they\'re in there when you need them. With a staggering penchant for detail, a proclivity to be both hilarious and deeply serious (and often in the same song), and a visceral embrace of roots music, he\'s made the kinds of songs nobody ever dreamed of before, or since.',

    'description' => 'Westword, KGNU and Twist & Shout Present WANDA JACKSON w/ guests When Wanda Jackson, the justly crowned Queen of Rockabilly, recorded "Let\'s Have A Party," a tune she made into a hit of her own in 1958 even after one-time boyfriend Elvis Presley had released a version of it, her delivery of the chorus wasn\'t so much a suggestion as a command. As the title - and, more importantly, the contents -- of her latest album, The Party Ain\'t Over, indicates, this feisty septuagenarian artist is as galvanizing as ever. Jackson was recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, honored with a long-time-coming, Early Influence accolade for her pivotal role in the evolution of popular music, especially where female artists were concerned. As a teenager in the mid-50s, the diminutive Jackson was the first woman to perform unadulterated rock and roll - and she one-upped the boys defining this new genre, Presley included, with her exhilaratingly forthright approach. The young Jackson, an Oklahoma native, came across as both gritty and glamorous; a playfully suggestive growl to her voice matched the daring, handmade outfits she wore, short skirts and fringed dresses that have inspired would-be bad girls for decades to come. A tireless touring artist for more than 50 years, Jackson continues to win over new, young fans, including guitarist-vocalist-White Stripes founder Jack White. On this debut for Third Man/Nonesuch Records, produced and arranged by White at his Nashville studio, the spirited Jackson proves that brash rock and roll attitude need not have an age limit. Her trademark growl remains intact on rockers like "Rip It Up" and "Nervous Breakdown;" she opens the set with an echo-laden sneer on a rollicking version of "Shakin\' All Over" and ends it ten songs later with a plaintive take on Jimmie Rodgers\' "Yodel #6," along the way gamely tackling country, gospel, densely worded Bob Dylan, and a little bit of Tin Pan Alley. Jackson and White are a remarkably simpatico pairing; their collaboration came together quickly, serendipitously. One of Jackson\'s colleagues had originally approached White about doing a duet with Jackson for a proposed "Wanda and Friends" disc, but White demurred. Instead, he offered something better, inviting Jackson to cut a single with him for his Third Man label, and that swiftly led this kindred spirits to put together an entire album. Jackson admits, "I was scared at first because I didn\'t know what this young rock star was going to expect of me or ask me to do. I kind of had shaky feet, deciding whether I wanted to do this or not. Of course I knew about him, I have to admit, from the album he did with Loretta Lynn and how successful that was. That certainly got my attention when he said he was interested in doing one with me. So we began sending material to each other; he sent me the things he thought I should do or he wanted me to do, and I sent him some ideas of things I had put aside for recording at a future date. When I finally got to Nashville, he put me at ease immediately. He\'s just so laid back and such a cool guy that I found myself wanting to please him, I wanted to do it his way. My husband (Jackson\'s manager of 40 years) and I told him, you do this. If you want a suggestion from me, feel free to ask. Otherwise, you make the decisions. That gave him a lot of freedom and I wanted him to have that freedom. And I think that\'s what made it so good as an album. As I began singing these songs and listening to the playbacks he made, I realized he wasn\'t wanting to change my style of singing at all. He just wanted me to have new, fresher material. And I said, hey I could do this. I can sing like Wanda Jackson. He just wanted more of Wanda than I was used to putting out. And apparently it worked." White and Jackson came up with inspired and wide-ranging song choices that reflect Jackson\'s long history with country, gospel, and even the big-band music she remembers from her childhood as well as with rock and roll: Harlan Howard\'s woozy lament "Busted"; the Andrew Sisters\' kitschy tropical travelogue, "Rum and Coca Cola", a fitting companion to her own "Fujiyama Mama"; Dylan\'s rockabilly fever dream, "Thunder On The Mountain". They also recorded a cover of contemporary bad-girl Amy Winehouse\'s "You Know That I\'m No Good," which White first released as a single in 2009, paired with "Shakin All Over." The Winehouse song suits her, Jackson says, but she\'s careful to draw the line between life and art: "On the one hand, I\'m good, on the other hand, I\'m bad. That seems to be the image this new generation of fans that I have has given me. It\'s like the title of the documentary about my life that recently came out: The Sweet Lady With the Nasty Voice. Maybe that says that I become a different person, a different persona, when I sing those songs. I have a good reputation, always have had, and respect from everyone as a lady, and that pleases me very much. But the young girls think I\'m this hard gal that gets her way and storms in. It\'s just because of the material I\'ve sung and the way I\'ve sung it. And that\'s okay. That\'s cute." White himself backs Jackson on lead guitar, cutting loose with solos that are as ferocious and fun as Jackson\'s vocals; in fact, the entire band that White assembled - including pedal steel, a horn section and backing vocals from singers Ashley Monroe and Karen Elson -is similarly uninhibited, matching Jackson\'s and White\'s intensity and, just as often, their humor. Though the work is carefully arranged, the resulting tracks feel like one unforgettable after-hours session, with everyone in thrall to the woman at the heart of these tunes. The first song White suggested they cut was "Rip It Up," one Jackson knows very well from her rockabilly days. As she explains, "It shocked me that he wanted me to do that but that was the first one I recorded. He loves that song and I do too. But I think he did that to put me at ease, let me do something that I\'m real familiar with and real comfortable with, and he didn\'t have to direct me or any of that. I just reared back and sang it. That got me loosened up and made me comfortable." Not that White simply wanted to make things easy. On the sultry "You Know I\'m No Good," says Jackson, "We\'d get through one take and he\'d say, \'Oh Wanda that was great.\' And I said, \'Whew, I made it.\' Then he said, \'Now let\'s do one more and let\'s push a little more.\' I was getting physically kind of tired and probably kind of got angry but he got the take he wanted. It\'s funny how you can come up with what your producers want in the strangest ways." A little bit of their repartee can be detected at the top of the track, just as the analog tape gets rolling. The Party Ain\'t Over is about stepping out, not summing up, but it does touch on important aspects of Jackson\'s life and ever-evolving career. "Teach Me Tonight," a country-inflected interpretation of the DeCastro Sisters\' hit, partly fulfills Jackson\'s desire to cut a 40s-style big-band disc. "Like A Baby," recorded live in the studio with the whole band, allowed Jackson to revive an obscure, bluesy number from her old buddy Elvis. The Jimmie Rodgers tune is the first song she ever learned as a child; her father taught her the chords on the guitar, she figured out how to sing along while she played, and, like any aspiring vocal star of the era, she taught herself how to yodel, a skill she has clearly maintained over the ensuing decades. Jackson remains too busy to look back - her legend looms especially large now in Europe and Japan, where she is always in demand as a concert performer - but she does allow herself a moment to reflect: "I can\'t think of anyone who could be any luckier or any happier than me. I think it\'s a blessing from the Lord. I had wonderful parents who gave up so much so that I could have my dreams come true. I was an only child so I had all the love and attention that anyone could ask for. My mother made my stage clothes and a lot of my street clothes too. Dad traveled with me and drove me to all those early dates so I didn\'t have to be alone. You couldn\'t ask for more, to make your living doing what you love to do, to sing and travel and entertain people all your life. I can\'t think of any life that could be better than that." And, as she notes, the party ain\'t over.',

    'description' => 'Colorado Daily Presents BEATS ANTIQUE Growing like wildfire under the canopy of live electonica and world roots music comes a masterful merge of modern technology, live instrumentation and seductive performance, built of brass bands and glitch, string quartets and dubstep: the musical trio Beats Antique. Since the group\'s inception from the eclectic underground of San Francisco\'s performance art scene, Beats Antique has been notorious for making it nearly impossible to sit still. They meld their mediums as attentively as they fuse the cultures that inspire their sound. All self produced and composed, the trio creates a unique collage: an animalistic, raw musical event that blurs the lines between the provocative, the spiritual, and the artistic, while still maintaining an allegiance to the muses of class and beauty. The journey that led to Beats Antique today was a winding and twisted path from the west coast to the ancient trade routes of the silk road. In this modern incarnation, the musical alliance of producers David Satori and Tommy Cappel is inspired and emphasized by their collaborative partnership with world-renowned belly dance performer and music producer Zoe Jakes. David Satori and Tommy Cappel both trained classically before venturing to locations such as Bali, West Africa, Serbia and beyond. With extensive backgrounds in multicultural music production, and the passports to prove it, Satori and Cappel command the spectrum of live and digital instrumentation, born from Hip Hop and old school jazz. Zoe Jakes adds a third dimension as the multi -cultural and -disciplinary dance counterpart to Beats Antique\'s sound. Jakes has worked with 2 major dance troupes, Miles Copeland\'s Bellydance Superstars and Rachel Brice\'s Indigo Belly Dance Company, a student of ballet and contemporary techniques. Jake\'s additional history with Cappel in the Extra Action Marching Band and the Yard Dogs Road Show grants some insight into the caliber of performance that is Beats Antique\'s standard. All of this sets the scene for Beats Antique\'s overtly ambitious stage show, a sensory overload conquest of the festival circuit\'s most riotous events, such as Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits festival, and Outside Lands, as well as a catalog of proper tours that include Bassnectar and a recent run with Les Claypool of PRIMUS in early 2010. According to Satori, the trio is excited by their ability to create a huge sound from their relatively small setup. "It gives us this whole new world of musical opportunities that we\'re just starting to scratch the surface of." In a prolific 3 years since Beats Antique emerged, the group has released 2 albums and a pair of EPs, with a third album, Blind Threshold, on the way. Notable features of the new release include vaporous violins and Danny Elfman-esque dementia; glitchy, laser-guided harmonica provided by Blues Traveler frontman John Popper; and 2 very different vocal tracks that range between restless pop hooks and vibrant Eastern European dance loops. All wrapped into an intricate collection of heavy beats and sub bass. Beats Antique is best imagined as an innovative creature built from the cumulative heritage of the world\'s music chasing its tail. However vivid that image, when a marching band groove crashes into bluesy folk chords only to be accompanied by electronic beats and Middle Eastern melodies, you\'ll still be surprised.',

    'description' => '97.3 KBCO & Westword Present MADELEINE PEYROUX Sunny War The third album in four years from song interpreter extraordinaire Madeleine Peyroux, Bare Bones is both an extension of the currents of 2004\'s Careless Love and Half The Perfect World and a bold step into previously unexplored psychological terrain. Produced, like its two predecessors, by Larry Kein, this fluid and enthralling new work, is Peyroux\'s most personal yet, hardly surprising considering she had a hand in writing each of the 11 songs, marking the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. "This really is a new experience for me - it\'s almost as if I got to make my first record again," she says. "Larry really was the first person who ever said to me, \'Let\'s write every song on the record - you should do this.\' I\'d co-written with Larry a couple of times in the past, but this was a big leap for me as a writer and also a deep exploration as a co-writer," Peyroux continues, "not only in the experience of writing but also the message I wanted to portray. Like the end of an event - being up all night, or when the rain stops and the sun comes out, it\'s a transitional moment of getting past some kind of struggle." Each of these 11 songs is like a gem, revealing its myriad facets one by one as it turns in the mind of the listener. \'Instead,\' co-written with her friend Julian Coryell, begins the album on a marvelously life-affirming note: "Instead of feelin\' bad, be glad you\'ve got somewhere to go," she purrs in her stunningly evocative alto, "Instead of feelin\' sad, be happy you\'re not all alone / Instead of feelin\' low, get high on everything that you love / Instead of wastin\' time, feel good \'bout what you\'re dreamin\' of." Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that every now and then the clouds break, offering a glimpse of a newfound, and hard-earned, lightheartedness - not something one would associate with this deep, deadly serious artist, whose previous outing have been steeped in melancholy. From a structural standpoint, Peyroux\'s aims as a writer involved "not having anything in the song that doesn\'t need to be there, but telling enough of a story to get everything that you do need. And if a song manages to really be clear in saying something that\'s practically impossible to say in plain language, that\'s the goal of songwriting, as well as performing a song." Peyroux likens the process of writing and recording these songs to "opening a shade onto sunlight in the morning - it just feels good. I\'m really happy that I got to write, and sometimes I\'m extraordinarily surprised because I like what we ended up with. I\'m really excited, because it feels like a new segment, and it\'s great work. I\'ve been surrounded by beautiful sounds, really honest musicians, really honest playing. It sounds like music to me."',

    'description' => 'Communikey Festival Presents DARK DARK DARK Flood Tide Remixed EARLY SHOW!! Listeners everywhere are having a very emotional response to Dark Dark Dark\'s music. Their sophomore album, titled Wild Go, is ambitious and layered, welcoming and familiar, and reminds us to seek out the wonder and magic that surround us all the time. Their sound sets Nona Marie Invie\'s soaring, haunted voice against an array of traditional instruments, balancing folk and high-art, creating music that is making people crazy. The 10-song collection is a marked evolution for the group, which began in 2006 as a collaboration between Minneapolis based musicians Nona Marie Invie and Marshall LaCount. These two songwriters bring together disparate influences including minimalism, New Orleans jazz, Americana, Eastern European folk, and pop. Using stark contrast in texture, tone and imagery, the band has expanded and redefined their sound for the new album. Wild Go\'s first single "Daydreaming" features Invie\'s warm voice and piano supported by spare, clean drums, guitar with lush reverb, cascades of dirty, distorted banjo, and an accordion wandering through the harmonies. The landscape created by the instruments reflects the one traveled by Invie - "I\'ve been touring for so long now - and it\'s been great," she says, "but I have this internal conflict between having a nomadic lifestyle and needing a home." In the studio the band worked with producer Tom Herbers (a Minneapolis stalwart known for his credits with the Jayhawks, Low, and Soul Asylum), recording live to tape at three different Minneapolis locations, including a renovated church/studio and an old theater. Of all the influences on Wild Go, perhaps the greatest is their dedication to live performance and touring, where many of Dark Dark Dark\'s songs first come to life. Playing together, the band lifts Invie and LaCount\'s songs to another level. "We try to create a magical space with our performances," Invie says. "I\'m always blown away by the number of people that come up to me afterward and say how much the music touched them. I love it when people can dance and have fun at our shows, but it\'s when people are quiet and I can tell that they are feeling it on a personal level that I feel like I\'m really connecting." Wild Go was released in October 2010 in the US on Supply & Demand Music, and will be released April 2011 on Melodic in the UK and Europe.',

    'description' => 'Westword and Twist & Shout Present SHPONGLE PRESENTS: THE SHPONGLETRON EXPERIENCE Random Rab & Hallucinogen The Shpongletron Experience makes its way around the US this spring, with 23 performances scheduled between April 12th and June 2th, including the Coachella Music and Art Festival. Known around the world for the mind-bending and fully immersive sensory experience that their concerts promise to deliver, Shpongle has raised the bar to new heights with the latest addition to their set-up. This year, UK-based DJ/Producer Simon Posford (the driving force behind Shpongle) is getting ready to hit cities across the US with a full-scale production tour entitled Shpongle presents The Shpongletron Experience. Quite literally a monumental creation, the "Shpongletron" itself is the brainchild of VJ Zebbler and Coast II Coast Entertainment. It is the visual expression of Shpongle\'s multi-dimensional auditory experience. Towering 18-feet above the stage and blasting audiences with 4 levels of psychedelic mayhem, concertgoers should expect nothing less than the best in modern eye candy. With platforms on each side of the structure for dancers to memorize the crowd with LED hula-hoops and other glowing art forms, a blooming lotus-like array of screens and an always enigmatic Posford at the center of it all, The Shpongletron Experience is like nothing Shpongle fans have ever seen before. The structure also features a 6-foot Shpongle Mask (the iconic face that often adorns Shpongle\'s albums) that virtually comes alive with projected visuals and animatronics. Shpongle will also be hurling the listener into unfamiliar territory by showcasing tracks off the just released The God Particle EP. To use their own words, "this maelstrom of beauty and surprise" is an experiment listeners will want to experience "time and time again to reveal the new exciting levels of far out musical adventures" that Posford and friends have been unveiling with their ever-evolving sound. Relative newcomer to the global scene, the San Francisco-based Random Rab will be supporting Shpongle on all tour dates except Coachella, offering up the unique and diverse sound he\'s known for bringing to sunrise sets at Burning Man.',

    'description' => 'FEMI KUTI & The Positive Force Those who have followed his career and have experienced his music know this for a fact: Femi Kuti never felt just satisfied with being the King\'s heir. He freed himself from his father\'s legacy in \'85 by putting together his own band, The Positive Force, and thereby working to find his own voice. He became, during the \'90s, a renowned artist in his own right with a distinctive, colorful and balanced style. His records tell the story: After a short spell at Motown, he took on the Afrobeat sound with his first international album in 1998 "Shoki Shoki", before rubbing shoulders with the modern urban style of his American peers such as Mos Def and Common on the album "Fight To Win". Returning to Lagos he worked on rebuilding the new Shrine and released an unbelievable live project recorded in the heat of the moment in his own venue ("Live at the Shrine", MK2 / 2004). Finally his first studio record only came about in 2008, having found inspiration in Paris. This unanimously celebrated release "Day By Day" was his most successful one. What was there left for him to accomplish from now on? To complete the cycle, Femi felt he needed to go back to his roots, to the origins of this burning feeling inside him which had fired all his work, and going back to the studio where he had produced his first recordings with his father and his solo album "Shoki Shoki". Decca Studio, soon to become Afrodisia Records in the \'70s, was the experimenting ground for most Nigerian masterpieces of the time, including those of Fela. "It was a very important historical place for Afrobeat and the place have those mystical vibrations that Femi felt", recalls Sodi, his longtime travelling buddy, and Parisian producer, who made the trip to Lagos to be a part of it. "We knew the studio was in a bad state, with old mixing desks, ancient equipment, we all knew the gear would not be up to the test, but we wanted to take up the challenge. Because everyting is different in Lagos. The city is such a monster; it has an effect on the way musicians play. The trick is to capture the Lagos stress without yielding under it yourself". And Femi gives us further insight : " Between the power cuts and the dysfunctional AC, we were sweating like pigs. I was playing with Sodi, pretending to complain: We could be in a comfortable place right now, what are we doing here? It was madness, but that\'s what we wanted it to be". This record may be less carefully produced than the former one. However this was not unintentional, but rather a conscious artistic choice, i.e. not to polish the finishing touches and keep this afrobeat rough in its purest form....." Aggressive is the word that Femi uses the most when talking about the album. This familiar Punk energy you hear is no surprise therefore even spiced up the African way! Here, the words echo the music perfectly. "Bad Government". Never has Femi been so vindictive. Or his words so concise. "Nobody Beg": "But never has my people\'s condition been so serious>> he justifies. As did his idols from the 60s, Coltrane, Parker, Gillespie, his militant spirit sometimes carries a jazzy jab that doesn\'t however lose any of its intensity. "Politics in Africa ". More than just a simple musician, the 48-year old composer has become a true African Ambassador, in its most honorable sense. Indeed the album recording had to be arranged around his busy schedule. For example, Femi was in Johannesburg to sing for Africa the opening ceremony for the Football World Cup. There he sang one of his hits << Beng Beng Beng >>, and took the opportunity to meet a few of the anti-Apartheid heroes. Shortly after, he was heading off to New York to see the famous and very successful Broadway musical about Fela, where he also got to appear on stage, invited by the actors at the end of the show. <<It\'s truly extraordinary, they really understood my father\'s struggle and his mindset This show has got to travel the world, and come down to the Shrine>>, he says naturally. Will we see Femi carrying out this project throughout the world? Maybe. In the meantime, his Shrine still carries the torch week in week out, so much so it has become one of the only last dynamic temples for live African music. Erykah Badu, Damon Albarn, Hugh Masekala have recently made appearances, as have the Lagos Police, who regularly raid the place, picking up and frightening off the local crowd, as they try to close down this highly regarded resistance venue. For the Shrine\'s 10th anniversary, coming this winter, Femi has plans to organize there an exceptional festival, following which he will be promoting his new album on stage.',

    'description' => '97.3 KBCO Presents IRON & WINE Over the course of his ten-year career, Iron & Wine\'s Sam Beam has become one of today\'s greatest story tellers, crafting meticulous tales full of forlorn love, religious imagery and wistful dreams. It\'s been more than three years since his last studio effort, The Shepherd\'s Dog, which was widely praised by fans and critics alike. While Beam\'s early albums were sparse, intimate solo affairs, Shepherd\'s introduced layered textures and poly-rhythmic sounds that allowed his lyrics to spring to life. It\'s only natural then, that Beam took this sonic collage and built upon it for his new album, Kiss Each Other Clean. The result is a brighter, more focused record that retains the idiosyncratic elements that make Iron & Wine such an engaging band. Beam continued to mine folk, African, rock, country, and Jamaican musical traditions, but switched the focus of his studio lens to 60s and 70s pop influences for the Kiss Each Other Clean sessions. Mingling memories of his parents\' record collection and hits heard between the static of scanning the car radio on family drives for inspiration, Iron & Wine is once again pushed into new territory. Multi-part vocal arrangements reminiscent of Buckingham / Nicks era Fleetwood Mac albums and classic Motown singles permeate "Half Moon" and "Godless Brother." Electronic synthesizer sounds percolate through "Monkeys Uptown" and "Glad Man Singing" recalling the adventures of Elton John and Stevie Wonder. The horn sections on "Big Burned Hand" and "Lazarus" match the confidence of Beam\'s vocal delivery and bring an entirely new dimension to Iron & Wine. Kiss Each Other Clean\'s dynamics and surprises are the latest chapter in Beam\'s studio collaborations. Producer Brian Deck returned for the Kiss Each Other Clean sessions, continuing the creative partnership that he and Beam have developed over the course of three albums. The comfort level and respect found between Deck and Beam allows for a unique working relationship where they push each other to experiment, while still letting the songs naturally evolve in the studio. The Shepherd\'s touring rhythm section Matt Lux, Ben Massarella (Califone), and Chad Taylor (Chicago Underground Duo) arrived early for live recording of basic tracks at Chicago\'s Engine Studios and overdubs continued for about a year. Joe Adamik (Califone), Jim Becker (Califone), Thomas Bartlett (Doveman), Stuart Bogie (Antibalas), Rob Burger and Sarah Simpson round out the other musicians brought into the sessions to complement and fully realize the songs on Kiss Each Other Clean. Kiss Each Other Clean\'s profound artistic statement continues to move the listener\'s expectation forward with regard to what one can expect from Iron & Wine. Beam\'s masterful storytelling and musical experimentation relies on the conflict from combining the happy and the sad, the heavy and the light, and creating an ongoing narrative between the artist and the listener. It\'s the blending of all of these elements that allows Kiss Each Other Clean the versatility to paint a true portrait of life.',
