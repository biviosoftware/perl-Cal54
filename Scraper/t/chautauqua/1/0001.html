<p>Pete &amp; Joan Wernick team with fellow musical couple, The Winstons, for a special Valentine&rsquo;s Concert and Sing-Along.&nbsp; The Wernicks are carrying forth a Valentine&rsquo;s tradition they began over ten years ago, now a highlight annual event. This year, they invite Boulder-based married duo, Cheryl &amp; Andy Winston, to share the close-up stage of the stylishly quaint Community House.&nbsp; The duos perform music ranging from bluegrass to folk and pop. Pete says, &ldquo;Count on a lot of harmony singing. Cheryl and Andy have such a pure blend. We'll each perform separate sets, then play all together including a sing-along of Valentine songs, with lyric sheets for the audience.&rdquo;<br /><br />Pete &amp; Joan Wernick are both members of Colorado&rsquo;s Bluegrass Hall of Honor. Pete (&ldquo;Dr. Banjo&rdquo;) is well-known for his many years as a driving force in Hot Rize. Joan plays guitar and is a soulful and stirring singer, as well as a favorite long-term deejay on KGNU&rsquo;s bluegrass radio show. The couple has performed nationwide and overseas, appearing in Ireland, Israel, and last summer at Russia&rsquo;s first bluegrass festival. Bluegrass Unlimited calls their sound "a marvelous collage of traditionally-flavored music." For more information on Pete &amp; Joan, visit <a href="http://www.DrBanjo.com" target="_blank">www.DrBanjo.com.</a><br /><br />Boulder-based duo Andy &amp; Cheryl Winston specialize in tight vocal harmonies over two guitars. With catchy original material and smooth picking, their pop/folk blend has won them appearances on national radio shows including Mountain Stage, at the Kerrville Folk Festival (TX), Founder&rsquo;s Title Folk &amp; Bluegrass Festival (UT), and more. &ldquo;Two voices that go down like the smoothest sipping whiskey... Lyrics that tug at the heart and intellect as well as melodic and harmonic ideas that satisfy, full of delights (Victory Review).&rdquo;&nbsp; For more on The Winstons, visit <a href="http://www.TheWinstons.com" target="_blank">www.TheWinstons.com.</a></p>

<p>Ahmed, son of Diana and Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, falls in love with Yasmin, a dancing girl who fronts her father's gang of mountebanks. Among the cutthroats is Ghobah, a villainous Moor to whom Yasmin is promised. In ruins near Touggourt, the city where Yasmin dances, she and Ahmed meet secretly until one night when her father and the gang capture the son of the sheik, torture him, and hold him for ransom. Will Ahmed believe that Yasmin set him up for capture?

<p>Anyone who longs for some good old-fashioned, sentimental and charming love stories of days gone by will love "True Heart Susie," written and produced by the father of film, D.W. Griffith. "True Heart Susie," which Griffith also directed, shows his deep, sensitive and compassionate film telling the story of a simple country girl's unwavering love for her childhood sweetheart. The simple essence of the story is about true love, and that the girls who use "paint and powder" are only temporary flirtations or mistakes men make, but true hearts like Susie's remain faithful and wait for their one and only true love. Along with superb acting by screen legend Lillian Gish whose face and demeanor suit innocent girl roles so well, Griffith brings out many delicate details and touching moments in the film, making it one of his best ever films.</p>

<p>Happy President's Day to all lovers of nature and rock n' roll!&nbsp; Join local science educators Mark Wesson, Jeff Kagan and Paige Doughty for a nature-themed children's concert complete with educational kid's music, scientific skits/stories, and plenty of audience participation. You might recognize the performers from the summer "Meadow Music" concerts on Monday evenings. Now, they reunite in the name of science for an hour-long concert of live acoustic (and a little electric!) music and plenty of kid "edu-tainment." Suitable for little folks ages 3 to 9 and adults who love the great outdoors.</p>
