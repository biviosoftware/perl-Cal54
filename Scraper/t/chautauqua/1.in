Griffith. "True Heart Susie," which Griffith also directed, shows his deep, sensitive and compassionate film telling the story of a simple country girl\'s unwavering love for her childhood sweetheart. The simple essence of the story is about true love, and that the girls who use "paint and powder" are only temporary flirtations or mistakes men make, but true hearts like Susie\'s remain faithful and wait for their one and only true love. Along with superb acting by screen legend Lillian Gish whose face and demeanor suit innocent girl roles so well, Griffith brings out many delicate details and touching moments in the film, making it one of his best ever films.',
