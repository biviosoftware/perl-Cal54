    'description' => 'The stats on DURAN DURAN are remarkable: a total of over 80 million records sold, 18 American hit singles, 30 UK top 30 tunes, and a global presence which guarantees them huge concert audiences on five continents. More remarkable still is the way they have achieved this, fusing pop music, art and fashion with a unique sense of style and confidence. When they first broke in the early 1980s Duran Duran single-handedly transformed music video from a gimmicky marketing tool into one of the music industrys most valued assets. With exotic locations, beautiful girls and stunning special-effects, Duran Duran took the visual imperatives of the New Romantic movement to another level. Their impact throughout the 1980s was such that Rolling Stone magazine adapting the old Beatles sobriquet dubbed them The Fab Five. Despite the occasional pause and some re-grouping in the 1990s, Duran today are an unstoppable force who still command the respect of the finest players in the game. On their last album, Red Carpet Massacre (released on Epic Records, November 2007) they collaborated with top producers Timbaland and Nate Danja Hills, as well as long-time Duran fan Justin Timberlake. For their next offering their 13th studio album: entitled All You Need Is Now (slated for digital release December 21st on iTunes and physically in February 2011) they have written and recorded with Grammy Award-winning producer Mark Ronson a marriage that all parties agree has been a match made in heaven. Formed in Birmingham, England in 1978, by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, Duran Durans early sound was an exciting stew of influences: the soul music of their youth, the vibrant New York underground music scene of the 1970s spearheaded by the New York Dolls and Velvet Underground, the iconic art pop of David Bowie and glam bands such as Roxy Music. At the time, John was at Art College and Nick was still in the 6th form at school. The first incarnation of the band was rounded out by another art student Stephen Duffy and a friend, Simon Colley who was at catering college. Simon played clarinet and bass, Nick had one small synthesizer and a drum machine, John played guitar and Stephen sang and played a fretless bass. After Simon and Stephen moved on Duffy to The Lilac Time and more recently Robbie Williams a number of new faces came and went before Roger Taylor, previously drummer with local punk heroes The Scent Organs, joined the band. With Roger on board, John took up the bass and the newly christened Duran Duran named after a character in Roger Vadims sci-fi classic movie Barbarella started to develop a funkier style, more in tune with some of the up-and-coming bands of the post-punk era such as Japan. They began to create waves in Birminghams premier music club, the Rum Runner. Listening to their demos, the clubs owners, Paul and Michael Berrow, gave them a residency and a rehearsal space. Auditions for new band members followed, with guitarist Andy Taylor answering an ad in Melody Maker and singer Simon Le Bon joining after being introduced by an ex-girlfriend, who bartended at the club. Unlike the rest of the band, Simon came from the suburbs of London, but was studying drama at Birmingham University. In the months that followed, the band worked tirelessly. By 1980, after supporting Hazel OConnor on tour, Duran Duran became the subject of a fierce record company bidding war. Eventually EMI Records came through, putting the band immediately into the studio with producer Colin Thurston. Their eponymous debut album sold more than 2.5 million copies in 1981, staying on the charts for an astonishing 118 weeks and spawning the giant hit single Planet Earth. That same year, Duran began to challenge expectations. They became the first pop act to produce a 12 remix single, for Planet Earth. and also released a controversial video, directed by Godley and Crme, for the dance mix of Girls on Film. Its sexually explicit content led to it being banned by both MTV and the BBC. Incorrectly perceived by the rock media as the poster-boys for a new generation of teeny boppers, Durans first major statement was the antithesis of a traditional pop album. The lyrical themes were adult-orientated, and the music while melodically bright and dance-fueled had a much darker quality. As the band themselves pointed out, there was a shadowy, European twist to the album. Songs like Careless Memories werent far removed in mood from bands like The Cure and Echo and the Bunnymen. What saved Duran Duran from the gloomy cul de sac of Goth, however, were their dance-inducing rhythms and Rhodes experimental electronics. Duran Durans ascent coincided with that of the so-called Second British Invasion which conquered America in the 1980s. Unlike contemporaries such as Spandau Ballet, Human League, Ultravox and Culture Club, they endured thanks to their exhaustive touring, imaginative embrace of new technology and superior song craft. Classic chart-toppers such as Hungry Like the Wolf, Rio and Save A Prayer soon turned Durans second album Rio multi-platinum worldwide. It was during this period that Princess Diana declared Duran Duran to be her favorite band, and new friends like artists Andy Warhol and Keith Haring publicly voiced their support. From 1983 the band went super nova. The video for Hungry Like the Wolf, which was filmed in Sri Lanka by director Russell Mulcahy, went on permanent rotation on MTV. Later that year Is There Something I Should Know went straight to #1 in the UK and hit #4 in the US. The bands third album, 1984s Seven And The Ragged Tiger earned Duran Duran their first Stateside #1, with The Reflex. In 1985 an invitation to write for the movie A View To A Kill earned the group another first when their song became the only Bond theme tune to make it to #1, an accomplishment that is still unrivalled today. Now that the Duran brand had become a license to print money, EMI wanted another album. For the first time in years, the band said no, taking time out to draw breath and regroup creatively. John and Andy teamed up with Robert Palmer, and former Chic drummer Tony Thompson to form the Power Station, with Chic bassist Bernard Edwards assuming production duties; while Nick, Simon and Roger embarked on a side project: Arcadia, with guest performers Grace Jones, Sting, David Gilmour and Herbie Hancock. While the Power Stations self-titled album found Andy and John moving further away from Duran Durans signature sound, with a loud hybrid of funk and glam rock, the Arcadia album So Red the Rose was a sublime reaffirmation of the mother ships style. Pulling threads of darkness from Duran Duran, and adding glittering shards of pop reminiscent of Rio and Seven and the Ragged Tiger, the albums first single, Election Day, was dark electro-dance-pop at its very best. In July 1985, the five members of Duran Duran reunited to play in Philadelphia at the historic Live Aid concert. Although no one knew it at the time, this would turn out to be the final performance of the original lineup. Chapter One of the Duran saga was now over. Other projects beckoned. In early 1986, John was approached to write the theme for the film 9 1/2 Weeks. In April, his solo tune I Do What I Do, charted on both sides of the Atlantic. As plans started to take shape for Duran Duran to begin work together again in the studio, drummer Roger Taylor abruptly announced that he wanted another year off and would be returning to his Gloucestershire farm. The four remaining band members convened in the studio in June, but before long they were down to three when Andy Taylor followed Roger into temporary retirement. With hindsight, he says his departure wasnt fuelled by a desire to embark on a solo career. This was, however, the outcome. With Andy gone, and Roger officially resigning shortly thereafter, Duran Duran were in free fall. But not for long. In August, the remaining trio were contacted by guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, whose own band Missing Persons had recently folded. Later that year Duran Duran Mark II teamed up with producer Nile Rodgers to record the funk-based album Notorious. The albums title track topped the charts, propelling the record to multi-platinum status. (Fourteen years later, the same song was sampled by Sean Puffy Combs on the posthumous Notorious B.I.G. release, Born Again). The band were back on a roll. Notorious was followed by Big Thing in 1988, and the release of Decade in 1990, celebrating what for them had been a glorious ten years. Their sixth studio album, Liberty, came out later the same year, with new drummer Sterling Campbell replacing two-time collaborator Steve Ferrone. In 1993, Nick, Simon, John and Warren went back into the studio to record Duran Duran 2. Better known as the Wedding Album because the album artwork featured photos of their parents weddings the CD spawned the award winning smash Ordinary World and its equally acclaimed follow-up Come Undone. Released the following year and garnering some of the best reviews of their career, as well as a prestigious Ivor Novello songwriting award, the Wedding Album sold more than four million copies around the world. A new generation of ardent Duranies were born. In 1995, Thank You, a covers album, gave the band a chance to pay homage to many of the artists who had inspired them over the years, such as Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, Led Zeppelin, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Later that year, Le Bon performed with tenor superstar Luciano Pavarotti at the War Child benefit concert in Italy. Other festivals and tour dates followed, while, between gigs, John Taylor teamed up with the Neurotic Outsiders, a quartet of rock and roll wastrels comprising former Sex Pistols Steve Jones, Guns N Roses bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Matt Sorum. Originally formed to play a benefit gig in LA their onstage jam led to them signing, for one eponymous album to Madonnas Maverick Records. In 1996, John Taylor officially left Duran Duran to pursue various solo projects. Undeterred, the following year the band contributed Out of My Mind to the film version of The Saint and released Medazzaland. The album featured Electric Barbarella, the first song ever to be sold in a download format across the Web. In 2000, after the release of two Duran tribute albums featuring artists as diverse as Kylie Minogue and Ben Lee on one, and the Deftones and Goldfinger on the other Hollywood Records put out the Pop Trash CD. The band supported this with an extremely successful international tour that featured the first ever use of augmented reality technology in a live concert. At the end of the tour, Warren Cucurrullo left for his original group Missing Persons. And then there were two As the 21st century loomed the future of Duran Duran lay in the balance. Simon took a well-earned break, while Nick joined his long time friend and original band mate Stephen Duffy, as The Devils, to work on an album, Dark Circles, which was released in late 2002. But no sooner had the dust settled, than the impulse for Duran Duran to evolve once more began to assert itself. Conversations jump-started old allegiances. And as 2001 rolled around Duran Durans original Fab Five went back into the studio to embark on writing together for their first album in almost eighteen years. Energized by the challenge of taking back their crown, Simon, Nick, Andy, Roger and John worked long and hard on an album which finally appeared on the Epic label in late 2004. Astronaut sold more than two million copies and was heralded by critics as one of their best studio efforts. The UK top five single (Reach Up For The) Sunrise earned the band their highest chart position in their home country for 20 years. The two-year world tour which accompanied Astronaut was a box office smash which saw them playing to more people, in more places, than ever before. This career-best concert outing served as a reminder that the band remained a fighting force with an incredible back catalogue, an awareness that led to them being honored with no fewer than five prestigious Lifetime Achievement awards in the space of two years. Between 2004 and 2006 Duran Durans extraordinary creative longevity was recognized by the MTV Video Music Awards, the BRITS, the Ivor Novellos, the Spanish music industry Ondas and Q Magazines annual Q Awards. With three generations of fans now on their case, Duran had no option but to record another album. Not even the departure, for the second time, of guitarist Andy Taylor, could dent their creative momentum. In September 2006, Simon, Nick, John and Roger flew to New York for a week-long collaboration with Grammy-award-winning producer Timbaland, studio sound genius Nate Danja Hills and Justin Timberlake. The sessions produced three to-die-for new tracks. The rest of the Red Carpet Massacre album was completed with Danja back in the UK, before one final session with Justin Timberlake, in Manchester, England in June 07, which produced the albums first single Falling Down. Over the next few months, Duran Duran performed at two of the biggest concert events on planet rock: the memorial Concert For Diana and the Live Earth eco-awareness bash, both at Wembley Stadium. A slew of promotional appearances then followed, in the lead up to the release of their 12th studio album, culminating in an unprecedented two week run on Broadway to launch the record. In 2008 the band hit the road once again, performing to hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe. As part of this year-long run they headlined festivals in a number of countries, played in arenas in others, became the first group to perform at the Louvre Museum in Paris and then two nights later, in the same city, treated fans to a specially-created mega-mix set that was filmed in a tiny theatre, with long-time-fan, Mark Ronson. This rare live performance, immediately proved that there was a powerful chemistry between Ronson and the band, and within just a few weeks a much larger collaboration had developed, with Mark committing to produce the bands 13th studio album. Starting out in the late Spring of 2009, at Sphere Studios in London, this much-anticipated Duran/Ronson union quickly flourished, as writing and recording began on an exciting new body of work, that Mark has boldly stated will be the imaginary follow up to Rio, that never was.. In July, the band took a short break from the studio to headline two special UK dates: the first a sold-out show at Edinburghs historic Castle, and the second at The Lovebox Weekender Dance Festival in East London. Super-star producer-in-residence, Mark Ronson made a guest appearance at both shows, while UK media darlings, Florence & The Machine, opened for Duran. Now with their new record All You Need Is Now completed, the bands future has never looked brighter. Having outlived most of their contemporaries, they have nothing left to prove and everything to play for. They are uniquely Duran Duran. *',

    'description' => 'Roger Daltrey has one of rock\'s most legendary voices\' but he doesn\'t take it for granted. As lead singer for The Who, he\'s lent his Olympian pipes to a staggering array of enduring rock \'n\' roll anthems. Who lead singer Roger Daltrey forged a parallel solo career beginning in 1973, when the group had begun to fall apart in the aftermath of Quadrophenia. Born March 1, 1944 in London, Daltrey grew up in the same Shepherd\'s Bush neighborhood as future Who bandmates Pete Townshend and John Entwistle, performing with them as the Detours as early as his late teen years. Over time, Daltrey developed into one of rock\'s most powerful lead vocalists, a position to which he staked his claim on the Who\'s 1971 masterpiece Who\'s Next; his onstage persona was one of macho swagger, accompanied by such antics as twirling his microphone like a lasso. Daltrey first traveled the solo route in 1973 with an album titled simply Daltrey, featuring mostly material penned by a then-unknown Leo Sayer that served as a departure from the Who\'s signature hard rock sound. The Who reconvened for The Who by Numbers in 1975, a year that saw Daltrey release his second solo album, Ride a Rock Horse, and appear in Ken Russell\'s films Lisztomania (as composer Franz Liszt) and an adaptation of Tommy (in the title role). While the Who went on hiatus for several years, Daltrey released One of the Boys in 1977 and appeared in the 1978 film The Legacy. During the Who\'s post-Keith Moon era, Daltrey co-produced and starred in the film McVicar, a biography of train robber John McVicar; members of the Who appeared on its soundtrack, which essentially served as a full-fledged Daltrey album and found him bridging the gap between hard rock and the pop songs of his earlier solo work. After the Who officially disbanded in 1983, Daltrey\'s solo albums became uniformly hard-rocking affairs, most notable among them 1985\'s Under a Raging Moon. In addition to the Who\'s 1989 reunion tour, Daltrey has since continued to act in occasional television and film roles, as well as releasing the solo album Rocks in the Head in 1992. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi *',

    'description' => 'Their forthcoming sophomore album, War Is the Answer, is locked and loaded with twelve tracks of raw epic heavy metal. Releasing September 22nd 2009 via Prospect Park/EMI, the record\'s deafening battle cry will undoubtedly rattle the genre to its very core and pull listeners deep into this War. Many were surprised to see the meteoric yet steady rise that 5FDP undertook in the last two year, and that was just the beginning. 5FDP have embarked on quite the journey to reach this point. The Los Angeles quintet\'s assault on heavy music began in 2007 with the release of their hit debut The Way of the Fist. After forming a "dream team" of metal musicians, the band self-funded the album- producing it entirely themselves. Death Punch eventually signed with The Firm/ Prospect Park. After months of relentless touring-including a show-stealing set at 2008\'s Mayhem Festival-Five Finger Death Punch became the hottest new band in metal. Hot as hell, in fact: sales for Fist have exceeded 335,000 in the U.S. alone, while Death Punch grabbed features in publications such as Revolver, Kerrang!, Guitar World, Billboard and Metal Hammer. Plus, Fist spawned three top ten singles on active rock radio-"The Bleeding," "Never Enough," and "Stranger Than Fiction." Each single grew very organically in popularity, inexplicably turning a metal band into one of the most-requested artists on rock radio. Capping off the Fist cycle in style, Five Finger Death Punch won the 2009 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for "Best New Band." However, it\'s all been simply a prelude to War. Five Finger Death Punch has fine-tuned their songs more than ever, and their sound has progressed immensely on their latest offering. Guitarist Zoltan Bathory puts it best: "We\'ve matured but we\'re still the same band. Maybe we\'ve gotten closer to traditional metal on War Is the Answer." Looking to surpass their DIY debut record, 5FDP decided to enlist some big guns for War. The band produced the album alongside world renowned producer Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne), and attracted legendary mixer Randy Staub (Metallica) to the project as well. Also, the band had grown together as people, performers and songwriters. Singer Ivan Moody relates, "We tried to keep the basic ingredients but expand the sound at the same time. We spent two and a half years on the road together, and these guys have become closer to me than my biological family." The result on War is an expansive collection of unbridled melodic metal. Tracks like "Bulletproof" illustrate Five Finger Death Punch\'s diversity, switching from spellbinding chorus to neck-snapping solo in a flash. "Burn It Down" is a nihilistic exploration in pure rage-a new storyline with the same popular characters from The Way of the Fist. Meanwhile, "No One Gets Left Behind" is an up-tempo crusher that leaves room for lyrical interpretation. "You can take it literally, or as an underlying theme we often talk about," relates Zoltan. "We are all soldiers in this human tribe. We used to fight together against the elements of nature to survive, but today that tribal bond is completely forgotten because there are six billion of us now. Does that devalue human life?" The band has been known for their intense guitar playing since day one, and War kicks it up several notches. Jason Hook joined the fold in 2008, lending an uncanny repertoire to the fold. "Jason\'s rhythm playing is very similar to mine," says Zoltan. "We have our signature sound all over War Is the Answer. It\'s a heavy machine gun style of playing. There are more solos because we wanted to utilize Jason\'s talent. We still focused on writing great songs though because those stay around forever." The songs on War will certainly stand the test of time, and the emotions encapsulated in them are extremely tangible. Ivan confronted many of his own demons, waging war through words. The singer says, "It\'s a more personal record. On War Is the Answer, the band encouraged me to write from the heart. There is a lot of stuff, as painful as it may be, that I tried to project on this album that I didn\'t get a chance to on the first record." "Walk Away" is an especially poignant song. The band incorporates acoustic guitars for a haunting, heavy sound, and the track\'s infectious, heartfelt chorus makes it a surefire single. "On \'Walk Away,\' I wanted to wash my hands of this particular relationship in my life that has gone sour. It\'s a cleansing. I really did put my heart and soul into this entire record-no matter how hard it was. You have to expose the most ugly and raw parts of your life to really convey anything." Ivan conveys true pain in his lyrics across the entire album. He pulls no punches, especially on the powerful "Crossing Over." His touching, episodic narrative propels the song under melancholy, melodic guitars. The entire album plays out in cinematic fashion with drama and true tension in every note. He continues, "We wanted to make an album that was going to feel like a major motion picture and not just an artsy B-movie." "Hard to See" could be the soundtrack to that epic. Ivan goes on, "The politics of the music industry have baffled me since day one. \'Hard to See\' is me lashing out at the industry. I\'m so tired of being pulled in every direction and being told what to do. The song is about melding into the industry and learning the politics so we can be freer as artists." The band\'s live show is more incendiary than ever. At the start, Five Finger Death Punch destroyed stages alongside Korn and Atreyu on The Family Values Tour 2007 and with Slipknot and Disturbed on the Rockstar Mayhem Festival 2008. Since then, they\'ve had numerous successful headline jaunts in the U.S. and in Europe, with many more to come. About their international appeal, Zoltan offers some insight. "If you really dig down to the roots of the music, American bands are groove-oriented and based on rhythm and blues. European bands grow up on classical music because it\'s very much embedded into that culture. Five Finger Death Punch has both of those roots because I\'m from Europe, and Ivan and the rest of the guys are American. We\'re a truly international metal band, and that fact separates us." The album\'s title sums everything up for the band right now. Zoltan elaborates, "War is the nature of man; it\'s always been, and it\'ll never go away. War has many different manifestations so it doesn\'t have to be taken literally, but that urge to conquer is embedded in our genes. We were not meant to live our lives caged in cubicles." Ivan follows, "I think everyone has their own personal battles whether they\'re religious, political or family-oriented. To us, The Way of the Fist was a swift punch to the face. War Is the Answer is the answer to that first album. You listen and you know we have to keep fighting. You can never just give up and throw it to the wayside. It shows a sign of weakness and we don\'t plan on doing that anytime soon." In the end, this record is for the people. Ivan concludes, "I want fans to be as proud of War Is the Answer as we are. We\'re not going anywhere. I want people to realize that this is from our hearts. I want the younger generation of musicians to realize if you stick to your guns and put forward the militant foot, you can get there. This band isn\'t afraid of anything. We will go out there, sweat, bleed and experiment-that\'s everything I\'ve looked for my entire life in a band. Mankind is nothing but a cluster of opinions and nobody knows the real answers. However you can move, even change people through music. That\'s power and real art" Indeed, Five Finger Death Punch are poised to take over the landscape. When it comes to how, there is no question-War is the Answer. *',

    'description' => 'Portishead formed in Bristol, England in 1991 and is credited with being one of the first bands to popularize the trip-hop genre. Their seminal 1994 album, Dummy, brought trip-hop to the British mainstream and introduced the music to the American "alternative" scene. The band is named after the town where founder Geoff Barrow grew up. At the dawn of the \'90s, Barrow was making a name for himself as a remixer, working with such artists as Primal Scream, Paul Weller and Depeche Mode. In addition, Barrow had produced a track for Tricky and written songs for Neneh Cherry. Aided by a financial grant, Barrow formed Portishead with vocalist Beth Gibbons, guitarist Adrian Utley and drummer Dave MacDonald. The band\'s first project was not an album but the short film To Kill a Dead Man. Barrow and Gibbons wrote and acted in the film; Portishead provided the soundtrack. The project attracted the interest of several record companies, including Go!Beat, which signed the band mostly on Barrow\'s skill as a remixer. Portishead\'s first album for Go! was Dummy, released in 1994. Promoting the album, however, was a big challenge for the label, as Barrow and Gibbons refused to do interviews and had no interest in touring. Go! was forced to tap all its creative-marketing resources, coming up with a campaign involving promotional mannequins ("dummies") displayed in various London locations. In addition, Portishead\'s videos for tracks like "Sour Times" and "Glory Box" created memorable visuals. Dummy received immense critical praise in England, topping many album-of-the-year lists. The record was a commercial success despite a lack of radio support; in early 1995, Dummy\'s third single, "Glory Box," debuted at No. 13 without the benefit of airplay. In America, the single "Sour Times" caught on at MTV, and Dummy sold over 150,000 copies without any live Portishead shows to promote it. In mid-1995, Dummy won the prestigious Mercury Music Prize as England\'s top album. Portishead, having become a big hit almost in spite of themselves, began writing material for a follow-up. However, creative tensions almost destroyed the band as Barrow, a self-described perfectionist, delayed the release of the new record. Portishead\'s self-titled second album finally came out in September 1997. Although it failed to expand the band\'s sound and its commercial success, Portishead was not viewed as a step backward. The band undertook a tour of Britain, Europe and the U.S. to promote the album. Portishead was followed by Glory Times, an album of remixes, and the live album PNYC, issued in November 1998 *',

    'description' => 'I\'ve been deep into electronic music my entire life. The first records I ever owned were Fat of Land by the Prodigy and Come To Daddy by Aphex Twin, raves Sonny Moore, better known as emerging electronic visionary SKRILLEX. Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails were also early influences. Ive been dabbling in making electronic tracks on programs like Fruity Loops since I was 14 years old. SKRILLEX is part of a new generation of artists that refuse to be restricted by preconceived notions or outside expectations. Genre has never been important to me, he insists. Ive never thought about music that way. Describing his current sound as a mix of dubstep, electro and glitch all thrown together, new SKRILLEX release SCARY MONSTERS AND NICE SPRITES reflects all of the above and beyond. The uplifting post-trance synth melodies of ALL I ASK OF YOU (featuring the soaring vocals of Penny) stands in stark contrast to the face-melting electro bass blasts of the massive electro-dubstep hybrid ROCK N ROLL (WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MOUNTAIN). Ive listened to so much music for so long, its more about instinct than influence, Moore explains about his sonic inspirations. Coming up, I was into a lot of artists on the Warp record label like Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, so SKRILLEX tracks are inclined to have more changes than most dance tracks normally have. I can draw influences from almost anything. I just like to mess around and create cool new sounds and noises. I just go where the music takes me. After just one hugely successful independent release, SCARY MONSTERS AND NICE SPRITES is the first SKRILLEX release on Big Beat Records, in conjunction with fellow electronic revolutionary Deadmau5s freshly minted Mau5trap record label. For years, the artists needed the record labels. I dont feel that way at all, Moore stresses. SKRILLEX has been 100% independent until now. I think its so important to be self-sufficient as an artist. Working with Atlantic / Big Beat, and cooperating with Mau5trap, allows us all to work as a team and expand on whats already been built. Following its release on Beatport, the 9-song EP dominated the charts on the site, with the title track claiming the site\'s #1 slot (the first time a dubstep track has ever done so), 8 songs breaking into the top 10, and multiple tracks claiming the #1 slots on several of the sites subgenre charts, including Dubstep, Electro House, Progressive House. Aside from the immediate success of SCARY MONSTERS AND NICE SPRITES, SKRILLEX has also made a name for himself as a highly sought-after remixer. Hes already produced officially commissioned remixes for such A-list artists as the Black Eyed Peas (Rock That Body), Lady Gaga (Bad Romance and Alejandro), and La Roux (In For The Kill). SKRILLEX stands not only at the vanguard of electronic dance music, but the perpetually evolving new music industry as a whole. For me, its important to believe in and love the music youre making. I gave away my first EP on my managers website, just so people could hear the music, he enthuses. It was downloaded by the thousands in just a couple of months, and it hasnt let up since. Thats all the inspiration I need to keep making music. SKRILLEX can be anything I want it to be, he continues hopefully. There are so many different avenues for music now. Video games, movie scores the possibilities are endless, and Im excited to be a part of it. *',

    'description' => 'Since 1974, Judas Priest has been one of heavy metal\'s most successful bands, issuing such all-time classic albums as 1980\'s \'British Steel,\' 1982\'s \'Screaming for Vengeance,\' and 1990\'s \'Painkiller,\' and such arena-rocking anthems as "Breaking the Law," "Living After Midnight," and "You\'ve Got Another Thing Comin\'." However, Priest\'s influence goes far beyond their music - they were the first metal band to embrace the \'leather biker look,\' a fashion that has since become synonymous with the musical genre. Additionally, Halford\'s powerful four-and-a-half octave vocal range and the twin guitar harmonies of Downing and Tipton have been \'studied\' by countless metal bands in Priest\'s wake. "The \'Nostradamus\' album - above all others - is perhaps the one I\'m most proud of," says Tipton. "Whilst in essence and character still very much Judas Priest, it has afforded the opportunity to explore areas of classical and operatic dimensions that the band normally wouldn\'t. As a guitarist and writer it has inspired me to greater heights and opened new doors to intrigue and passion. From start to finish, it will take you through a magical experience filled with light, shade, drama, melody and emotion that reflects this unique man and his life." *',

    'description' => 'Dierks Bentley and his close-knit band played more shows in more places in 2004 than a body should be able to take or a mind should remember, but one night stands out as a distilled dose of the year\'s magic. At 8 p.m. sharp, Dierks took the stage at the Memphis Pyramid and sang for 30 minutes for some 20,000 people, setting the table for veteran superstar George Strait. Then, he and his band hopped on the bus, drove a couple hours to Oxford, Mississippi and set up for a raucous late-night show for 150 college students in the basement of an Ole Miss frat house. "We went from one of the biggest lighting rigs you can have to a three-ring light tree," Dierks remembers with a laugh. "The extension cord caught on fire and the lights went out for twenty minutes." Not so many years ago, he was singing for tips in Second Avenue bars and soaking up country music history at his day job working in the video tape library of the late, great Nashville Network. Today he\'s among the most successful and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn\'t work like this anymore - that talented strivers with no connections don\'t stand a chance. But Dierks Bentley proved that Music City\'s engine still runs and that as a place for education, inspiration and validation, it has no parallel. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. There are precious few new artists recording hits today about whom that can be said. Bentley\'s kind of country has never been straight-up-the-middle. Instead, the Arizona-native grew up on a potent hybrid of honky-tonk, bluegrass, singer/songwriters, classic country and modern rock & roll, forging his own sound along the way. "I love the feeling of combining the best older stuff with the edginess of newer, more progressive sounds,"says the prestigious CMA Horizon Award winner. " I try to take the real life connectedness of the stories and songs of Hank Williams and Buck Owens, and then try to put a fresh modern sound to it." After selling almost 5 million copies of his previous three studio albums, which included 10 top-10 singles and five No. 1 hits - most country artists with comparable achievements would be reluctant to veer off a proven hit-making path. Bentley is the exception. He shuns the comfort zone and welcomes the risk of what he refers to as "almost bringing the element of failure back into the mix." "I\'m not the kind of guy, who wants to go into the studio every two years and just keep putting out more of the same because it has worked so far," says Bentley. "I really wanted to change our initial approach to the recording process...do it in more of a rock and roll, or an old outlaw kind of country way. Use your guys; go in the studio; take the clock off the wall." After spending more than two years writing, road testing and recording new material, Bentley is ready for the next phase: the Feb. 3 release of Feel That Fire, a 12-song serving of rockers and ballads with a dash of honky tonk and bluegrass. It is all fire and passion that Bentley and co-producers Brett Beavers and Luke Wooten claim has driven the entire process from the moment the first song was conceived to the sleepless nights spent imagining creative ways to perfect the on-stage delivery. As an avid music fan himself, Bentley understands that to connect with a lot of people, the instrumentation must be as diverse as the people packing the arena. And with Feel That Fire, Bentley continues to engage all types of fans with sounds ranging from arena-sized electric guitars to upright bass and banjos on steroids. From the opening slide guitar rampage that channels a Harley hauling ass in the outlaw lament "Life on the Run" to the closing-time camaraderie of the duet and bluegrass jam with bluegrass great Ronnie McCoury "Last Call," Feel That Fire has the pulsing energy, passion and dynamic sensibility of his praised live show. Bentley\'s vintage free \'n easy spirit is still present in abundance, but it\'s rounded out with a more thoughtful take on the vastness of life and love. The title track and first single, Bentley\'s 11th top 10, came out of a writing session with fellow tunesmiths Beavers and brothers Brett and Brad Warren. The foursome combined their experiences to extol the virtues of a woman\'s innate quirkiness and thrill-seeking nature as defined by the man who loves her. On the wild side, the gravel-flying, good-timing Saturday night special "Sideways" pays tribute to a guy\'s occasional need to cut loose. Similarly, the infectious "Here She Comes" and "Little Heartwrecker" are classic Bentley and showcase stellar instrumental jams from Nashville\'s finest. "I feel a responsibility to other guys like me, who just want to cut loose, drink beer and hear some great picking." The Conway-esque "I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes" is a song that Bentley says "can\'t be more intimate, more one-on-one, man-to-one woman if you tried." Bentley adds, "One of the best compliments I can get is when a guy comes up to me and says that one of my songs helped him out at home, maybe helped him smooth something over, with his girlfriend or wife. That\'s the goal with this one." In a similar fashion, Bentley takes a modern approach to "I Can\'t Forget Her," delivering a sultry Spanish groove, mixed with The Edge-esque guitar sounds, transporting the listener to the scenic landscapes of the Old Southwest. "Beautiful World" teams Bentley with one of his favorite singers, Americana icon Patty Griffin. The poignant song about recognizing there are two ways to look at your reality and appreciating life despite the daily delivery of bad news is a simplistic yet powerful ballad. "It\'s a fine line to walk because you don\'t want to act like everything is great when it\'s not, but the point is that if you choose to believe in something, hopefully your beliefs will lead to action. Patty\'s voice adds so much depth that I can\'t even remember what it sounded like without her." "You Hold Me Together," an uplifting mid-tempo rocker, has Bentley offering appreciation to the one who watches over him. "It\'s a love song, but also a spiritual song. I try and write songs that break that boundary and can mean different things to different people." In a similar vein, "Better Believer" takes stock of life\'s blessings and recognizes the need to be more grateful. "It\'s the truth," Bentley says of the song he co-wrote with Rivers Rutherford. "It\'s exactly the way I feel. It is as honest as I\'ve ever been in a song." Continuing the introspective theme, Bentley draws on personal experience for the Rodney Crowell collaboration "Pray," where forgiveness and hope are extended to a former love. "Rodney\'s the kind of guy that you can go to his house, bare your soul and craft a really meaningful song that will stand the test of time." For Bentley, Feel That Fire is about the passion of the moment. "As a songwriter and a human being, I want to experience all that I can in this one life we are given...it\'s all about moving forward but remembering where you came from...the best music is made in the journey." *',

    'description' => 'You can\'t force artistry. True musical creations are typically launched via pure inspiration or serendipitous moments and ideas that are often baked to perfection through sheer work and dedication. Still, many musical artists have opted to churn out songs with a cookie-cutter, assembly line mentality, cramming albums with formulaic songwriting, by-the-book tolerances and the kind of bullish one-upmanship that\'s more commonly seen in a corporate - and definitely not creative - environment. But looking back at the career of Rise Against, one can see that the band\'s reach also grew organically from its roots in the national underground punk scene to a phenomenon that has touched the lives of millions of listeners across the world - nothing was charted nor prescribed. With equal doses of perseverance, conviction, artistry and commitment, Rise Against rose from the local Chicago scene through its earliest independent releases, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions Per Minute (2003). After landing the opening slot on high-profile national tours and joining the Vans Warped Tour roster, the profile of Rise Against sharply rose outside of the occasionally insular underground. The lyrical content of the songs on Appeal to Reason have also greatly widened Rise Against repertoire\'s spectrum. "The Strength To Go On" finds McIlrath further questioning the information that\'s disseminated into society. The touching acoustic-based "Hero Of War" puts Rise Against dead in the center of a generation of military service personnel who are battling their own personal wars outside of those in the Middle East. Partially based on true stories, the song is actually an amalgamation of a number of characters, starting with military recruitment. The second verse documents situations at Abu Gharib, Guantanamo Bay, and the Haditha revenge killing for an IED explosion. And the song\'s third verse was based on a true story after McIlrath watched a documentary called "The Ground Truce." Moved by the film, McIlrath wrote a majority of the song inspired by the stories and images presented in the documentary. The album\'s first single is the straightforward, four-chord heavy rocker "Re-Education (Through Labor)." "It\'s a good way to start off this new record, because I think the album has a lot of progression and something different to offer," says Principe, "and I think that song represents us the best." Of course, none of the songs on Appeal to Reason are able to make much of an impact if there isn\'t an audience to receive them. And for McIlrath, creating connections to the band\'s audience is of paramount importance - regardless of size, scenes or musical styles. "It\'s still about reaching people, putting what we\'re giving into these people, making them think and challenge the ways of thought, creating conversation and dialogue and putting new ideas forth for people to consider," says McIlrath. "And when you have a bigger fanbase, that\'s even more fun to do, because all of a sudden your voice is louder. Now you have a bigger bullhorn than you actually have. It\'s exciting and fun and I look forward to the next couple years with this record. Now that we have a fanbase, it\'s just a question of what are we going to do when we\'ve been given the privilege that we\'ve been given." *',

    'description' => 'It ain\'t easy being a gypsy, especially if one sings for their supper. San Francisco\'s Tea Leaf Green are newfangled Lost Boys, a traveling gang dedicated to seeking wisdom and experience in places both glorious and seedy. In many ways, this quintet is the essence of rock\'s adventurous, playfully outlaw spirit, all of which ultimately fuels songs that resonate with classic vibrations, open-ended possibilities and radio-ready charm. TLG are bruised romantics with heavy minds and a lighthearted way with experimentation, as likely to jam out a number as they are to nail a primo verse-verse-chorus pop gem. All the steadily growing promise, evident since they began in the late 1990s, comes to fruition on their seventh studio album, Radio Tragedy. With the aid of producer Jeremy Black (Apollo Sunshine), the band has crafted a powerhouse work with the oomph of their stellar live performances melded to a truly impressive array of vocal nuance, rib-sticking song craft and smart studio flourishes. From the Bee Gees-esque bite of "Easy To Be Your Lover" to the bouncing modern rock of "You\'re My Star," Radio Tragedy showcases a contemporary American rock monster fully emerging from the shadows, ready to take on any comers with a sound that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with skilled contemporaries like My Morning Jacket and The Strokes. Together, Trevor Garrod (keys, vocals), Josh Clark (guitar, vocals), Scott Rager (drums), Reed Mathis (bass, vocals) and newest member Cochrane McMillan (drums) have made a record that\'s both timely and timeless - a strange, beautiful space that Tea Leaf Green inhabits naturally and gracefully. *',
