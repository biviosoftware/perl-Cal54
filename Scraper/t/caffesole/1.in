Tom\'s warm baritone and engaging scat solos invite the audience into the musical dialog, while Paul\'s stratospheric tenor and pianistic polychromatism provide a playful and sometimes challenging counterpoint. When you hear them play together, you\'ll understand why one excited audience member said "This is the best jazz I\'ve ever heard in Boulder."',
