As she puts it, \"I've always carried around this intense feeling that this was what I was meant to do with my life. I don't know where the feeling came from and I don't remember when it began. I just know that I can't remember a single moment in my life when I didn't feel this way. I never had a choice in what I would pursue; singing pursued me and that was it.\" But she wouldn’t have it any other way. With a vocal style that sounds like a mix of Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders, PJ Harvey and Norah Jones, she’s gaining well-deserved enthusiastic reviews wherever she plays, from The Meadowlark to Michelangelo’s Wine Bar. Becoming the performer she is now, however, didn’t happen overnight. Now living in Denver, Lindsay decided a few years back to become a Professional Singer. While honing her natural gift, she picked up guitar to allow herself the opportunity to perform publicly. She also began to write her own songs to “try something new” and express herself in way she felt she “wouldn’t necessarily be able to with someone else’s songs”. In early 2009, after spending several months as a solo musician performing around town, Lindsay became a vocalist for The Fever, a successful, local band. Since then, the group gained enough attention that it became necessary to form another band in order to accommodate events. Lindsay now fronts \"3rd Degree\" as their Lead Vocalist, as well as continuing to perform with original group. Her main focus, however, is continuing her successful, solo, acoustic act. This stage in her life and in her music is, “the most fulfilling yet…I can’t wait to see what else happens down the road”. Catch Lindsay and her voice around the Denver area this summer. \n\nwww.myspace.com/lindsaymeredithmusic","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid\u003dZWRibWQxaXZoZzJoZmhxYzB2YTZlbmp2Z29fMjAxMTAzMjQgdGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdnb2F0QG0"}],"gd$eventStatus":{"value":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event.confirmed"},"gd$where":[{"valueString":""}],"gd$when":[{"endTime":"2011-03-24T21:00:00.000-06:00","startTime":"2011-03-24T20:00:00.000-06:00"}]},{"id":{"$t":"th1torv798kk0bfp2ijuapkstg_20110123"},"title":{"$t":"Kristi Stice","type":"html"},"content":{"$t":"Kristi Stice:\n\nKristi Stice is a dynamic songwriter with a wide variety of musical influences as diverse as Leonard Cohen, Jolie Holland, and Billie Holiday.

As she puts it, \"I've always carried around this intense feeling that this was what I was meant to do with my life. I don't know where the feeling came from and I don't remember when it began. I just know that I can't remember a single moment in my life when I didn't feel this way. I never had a choice in what I would pursue; singing pursued me and that was it.\" But she wouldn’t have it any other way. With a vocal style that sounds like a mix of Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders, PJ Harvey and Norah Jones, she’s gaining well-deserved enthusiastic reviews wherever she plays, from The Meadowlark to Michelangelo’s Wine Bar. Becoming the performer she is now, however, didn’t happen overnight. Now living in Denver, Lindsay decided a few years back to become a Professional Singer. While honing her natural gift, she picked up guitar to allow herself the opportunity to perform publicly. She also began to write her own songs to “try something new” and express herself in way she felt she “wouldn’t necessarily be able to with someone else’s songs”. In early 2009, after spending several months as a solo musician performing around town, Lindsay became a vocalist for The Fever, a successful, local band. Since then, the group gained enough attention that it became necessary to form another band in order to accommodate events. Lindsay now fronts \"3rd Degree\" as their Lead Vocalist, as well as continuing to perform with original group. Her main focus, however, is continuing her successful, solo, acoustic act. This stage in her life and in her music is, “the most fulfilling yet…I can’t wait to see what else happens down the road”. Catch Lindsay and her voice around the Denver area this summer. \n\nwww.myspace.com/lindsaymeredithmusic","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid\u003dZWRibWQxaXZoZzJoZmhxYzB2YTZlbmp2Z29fMjAxMTAyMTAgdGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdnb2F0QG0"}],"gd$eventStatus":{"value":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event.confirmed"},"gd$where":[{"valueString":""}],"gd$when":[{"endTime":"2011-02-10T21:00:00.000-07:00","startTime":"2011-02-10T20:00:00.000-07:00"}]},{"id":{"$t":"qon3qnmuuhs810ho6qh8g67pn8_20110408"},"title":{"$t":"Naropa Afropop Ensemble","type":"html"},"content":{"$t":"","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid\u003dcW9uM3FubXV1aHM4MTBobzZxaDhnNjdwbjhfMjAxMTA0MDggdGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdnb2F0QG0"}],"gd$eventStatus":{"value":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event.confirmed"},"gd$where":[{"valueString":""}],"gd$when":[{"endTime":"2011-04-08T21:00:00.000-06:00","startTime":"2011-04-08T20:00:00.000-06:00"}]},{"id":{"$t":"i8udukvmfial6df60lmosob5k0_20110215T030000Z"},"title":{"$t":"&quot;So, You&#39;re a Poet,&quot; presents Saint Valentine&#39;s Day Open Poetry Readng","type":"html"},"content":{"$t":"''So, You're a Poet,'' presents Saint Valentine's Day Open Poetry Readng:\n\nThe ''So, You're a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' has several Kerouac events on its poetry calendar.

The group concept is to play heartfelt music avoiding preconceived commercial prerogatives. As Sun Ra said, “Space  is the place.” We love the space and mysterious places in the music.\nThe core personnel of the group are Steven Ignelzi/guitar, Kurt Ehrenman/woodwinds, Bill Capsalis/Bass, Stephen Thurston/keyboards, Tate Ignelzi/Drums, Gregg Wilkins/percussion. The group expands like the universe and contracts like an accordion to fit the occasion and to operate within the spirit of jazz and the circumstances.\nThe musical presentation stresses good times and off color arrangements to create the steller atmosphere.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/signelz","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid\u003dbmUxNWs0Z2diOW5xM3YyYzl1cmNjZmUxY2dfMjAxMTAyMjUgdGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdnb2F0QG0"}],"gd$eventStatus":{"value":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event.confirmed"},"gd$where":[{"valueString":""}],"gd$when":[{"endTime":"2011-02-25T22:30:00.000-07:00","startTime":"2011-02-25T21:00:00.000-07:00"}]},{"id":{"$t":"bqj4e9cisb0gbaoj087188dkak_20110112"},"title":{"$t":"Steve Waitt","type":"html"},"content":{"$t":"Steve Waitt:\n\nSteve Waitt is an emerging New York artist who has attracted the attention of the countries hottest underground songwriter scene.

Primarily inﬂuenced by gypsy-tinged bands like Beirut and Devotchka, Jared merges genres to create a sound that is all his own, combining Eastern European folk with classical arrangements and occasionally returning to his more blues- based roots. His versatility is best noted by his ability to create songs that vary from darkly dramatic to fast-paced fusions of accordion and middle-eastern melody. Today, his live shows span from solo performances to large ensembles, with percussionist Aaron Kavelman using everything from bundt cake pans ﬁlled with water to hollowed out World War II bombshells to recreate the vivid sonic pictures captured in their studio recordings. Sharing the stage with artists like John Vanderslice, Richard Buckner and Southeast Engine has allowed Jared to perform for audiences that value a richer, raw sound accompanied by lyrical poeticism.

His Texas friends introduced him to Joe Ely, Jimmy Dale Gilmore, Tish Hinojosa and Marcia Ball; his Nashville friends turned him on to Steve Young, Steve Earle, Rodney Crowell and Roseanne Cash.

With themes including love won and lost, the pursuit of the American Dream, and the promise of the open road, Hoffman’s songs strive to connect with universal truths and explore the light and the shadows of love and life.
