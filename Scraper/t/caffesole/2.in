    'description' => 'Zachary duPont

The domination of pop culture amongst the masses has created a subterranean, "self sufficient", independent music scene. In this realm, the great songwriters of today dig deep into expression with a purpose. Zack duPont certainly falls into this category in more ways than one. In duPont\'s world, authenticity and truth are the core values that nourish the vulnerability of his song craft. He is not afraid to dwell in the most extreme of emotions, in fact he embraces them as they come.

"Simply put, duPont is an elite guitarist. Here and throughout the album, his attention to dynamic subtlety - in addition to immaculate technical polish and engaging melody lines - is remarkable."

"Similarly, duPont\'s vocal performance is intimate, nuanced and affecting. He appears to take as much care with his hushed delivery as he does with his impressively understated guitar work."

"Each of his talents works fully in concert with the others. Imagine M. Ward collaborating with Iron and Wine. The word you\'re looking for is \'sublime.\'"
-Dan Bolles, Seven Days VT

Before Lindsay Meredith knew much about anything, one thing she knew was that she was born to sing. As she puts it, "I\'ve always carried around this intense feeling that this was what I was meant to do with my life. I don\'t know where the feeling came from and I don\'t remember when it began. I just know that I can\'t remember a single moment in my life when I didn\'t feel this way. I never had a choice in what I would pursue; singing pursued me and that was it." But she wouldn\'t have it any other way. With a vocal style that sounds like a mix of Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders, PJ Harvey and Norah Jones, she\'s gaining well-deserved enthusiastic reviews wherever she plays, from The Meadowlark to Michelangelo\'s Wine Bar. Becoming the performer she is now, however, didn\'t happen overnight. Now living in Denver, Lindsay decided a few years back to become a Professional Singer. While honing her natural gift, she picked up guitar to allow herself the opportunity to perform publicly. She also began to write her own songs to "try something new" and express herself in way she felt she "wouldn\'t necessarily be able to with someone else\'s songs". In early 2009, after spending several months as a solo musician performing around town, Lindsay became a vocalist for The Fever, a successful, local band. Since then, the group gained enough attention that it became necessary to form another band in order to accommodate events. Lindsay now fronts "3rd Degree" as their Lead Vocalist, as well as continuing to perform with original group. Her main focus, however, is continuing her successful, solo, acoustic act. This stage in her life and in her music is, "the most fulfilling yet...I can\'t wait to see what else happens down the road". Catch Lindsay and her voice around the Denver area this summer.

With influences drawn from the American Roots Music tradition, TLDOTY cooks together their vast experience in folk and country, indie-rock, and Canjun/zydeco.  They deliver up steaming plates of new-fangled, old-timey, foot-stompy, modern tall tales. Strong and strange storytelling mixes with unconventional arrangements on traditional country, roots, folk, and rock song structures to bring you their brand of fiery outlaw Americana.

In Boulder, where Hoffman calls home, he has studied with Jock Bartley of Firefall fame, the late Jeffrey Edge, noted guitarist with Watson & Edge, and local guitar hero Steve Glotzer. With acoustic and electric instruments and vocal harmonies, Hoffman\'s original music reflects growing up in an American cultural stew of rock, country, blues, R&B, jazz and funk. With themes including love won and lost, the pursuit of the American Dream, and the promise of the open road, Hoffman\'s songs strive to connect with universal truths and explore the light and the shadows of love and life.

Laughing Goat 5 year anniversary

The \'\'So, You\'re a Poet\'\' reading series by Boulder\'s \'\'beat book shop\'\' has several Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in this venerable, decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg, Bernadette Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program), Diane di Prima, Janine Pommy Vega, Anselm Hollo, and many more. The series has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters, owner of the Pearl Street landmark \'\'beat book shop.\'\'

The series was hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction to Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes \'\'One thinks of the legendary Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born, or the cafes and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement, also the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe, both in New York City\'s East Village.\'\'
The series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka, Miguel Algarin, Lewis MacAdams, and other poets read there during last year\'s Summer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary institution in the making.',

While recording his new acoustic EP, Calm, in Brooklyn last year,
Dustin Edge drew on influences such as Nick Drake, Richard Buckner,
and Vic Chesnutt to create a new collection of insouciant songs to
complement life amidst the swift and chaotic nature of the Big Apple.
Recorded inside the frenetic artist enclave of the McKibbin lofts in
East Williamsburg, the Calm EP is laden with ruminations on the search
for contentment among tumultuous times. The project represents a
complete shift in genre following the hyper-charged By The Numbers EP
that Edge released last March, an endeavor steeped in mathematical
qualities and numeric order. Edge recently moved to Boulder, Colorado,
where he is in the midst of rehearsing for a summer tour. "I miss New
York quite a bit actually, having all that energy around me. There\'s a
different type of energy here though. It\'s undoubtedly different than
New York, but just as valid."

Before Lindsay Meredith knew much about anything, one thing she knew was that she was born to sing. As she puts it, "I\'ve always carried around this intense feeling that this was what I was meant to do with my life. I don\'t know where the feeling came from and I don\'t remember when it began. I just know that I can\'t remember a single moment in my life when I didn\'t feel this way. I never had a choice in what I would pursue; singing pursued me and that was it." But she wouldn\'t have it any other way. With a vocal style that sounds like a mix of Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders, PJ Harvey and Norah Jones, she\'s gaining well-deserved enthusiastic reviews wherever she plays, from The Meadowlark to Michelangelo\'s Wine Bar. Becoming the performer she is now, however, didn\'t happen overnight. Now living in Denver, Lindsay decided a few years back to become a Professional Singer. While honing her natural gift, she picked up guitar to allow herself the opportunity to perform publicly. She also began to write her own songs to "try something new" and express herself in way she felt she "wouldn\'t necessarily be able to with someone else\'s songs". In early 2009, after spending several months as a solo musician performing around town, Lindsay became a vocalist for The Fever, a successful, local band. Since then, the group gained enough attention that it became necessary to form another band in order to accommodate events. Lindsay now fronts "3rd Degree" as their Lead Vocalist, as well as continuing to perform with original group. Her main focus, however, is continuing her successful, solo, acoustic act. This stage in her life and in her music is, "the most fulfilling yet...I can\'t wait to see what else happens down the road". Catch Lindsay and her voice around the Denver area this summer.

There is an old photograph of Jared Bartman, age two, standing in shorts, a blazer and a bow-tie, wildly strumming a child-sized plastic guitar. In the years that followed, Jared\'s musical repertoire grew to include piano, accordion, and mandolin. Primarily inﬂuenced by gypsy-tinged bands like Beirut and Devotchka, Jared merges genres to create a sound that is all his own, combining Eastern European folk with classical arrangements and occasionally returning to his more blues- based roots. His versatility is best noted by his ability to create songs that vary from darkly dramatic to fast-paced fusions of accordion and middle-eastern melody. Today, his live shows span from solo performances to large ensembles, with percussionist Aaron Kavelman using everything from bundt cake pans ﬁlled with water to hollowed out World War II bombshells to recreate the vivid sonic pictures captured in their studio recordings. Sharing the stage with artists like John Vanderslice, Richard Buckner and Southeast Engine has allowed Jared to perform for audiences that value a richer, raw sound accompanied by lyrical poeticism. He is currently supporting his latest release, Jersey Shore, with shows throughout the Midwest and East Coast. A series of 7-inch records will see a limited vinyl release early next year.

Dastardly:

The marriage between old west folk and the ambiguous genre of "indie rock" makes the songs of Dastardly a palatable playlist for those who aren\'t normally attracted to cowboy crooners. In fact, by the sound of the screaming girls heard at Subterranean, we\'re pretty sure the band was responsible for converting quite a few pop princesses into banjo loving broads. Experimental enough to feel fresh but traditional enough to feel familiar even to
first timers, Dastardly is band that asserted itself as notable early in the game and now can enjoy the steady rise to local fame they\'re guaranteed.

Most of us players should be humbled by Cahalen Morrison, the 24 year-old guitarist, singer, blues and old-timey interpreter, and multi-instrumentalist (six-string fingerstyle, claw-hammer banjo, mandolin, and lap slide guitar for starters). If not humbled, we are curious; how did the former New Mexico resident attain this kind of musical maturity at twenty-four? His biography explains somewhat: Amongst red rocks, dry soil, and clear sky, Cahalen Morrison was reared on Hot Rize, Doc Watson, Norman Blake and Rory Block while running around in a diaper, trying (at times unsuccessfully) not to fall into patches of prickly pear. Now, he\'s got the ears for roots music. Hopping effortlessly from fingerpicking to mandolin, clawhammer banjo to lap slide guitar, Cahalen\'s writing encompasses everything from punchy political commentaries, to soul warming serenades, branching out into instrumental rags and fiddle tunes, yet still retaining his subtle musical signature. Joining Cahalen will be flatpicker, octave mandolin & clawhammer banjo player extraordinaire, Eli West, of Seattle.

Born in Akron, Ohio, Davis spent his childhood listening to records from his father\'s massive collection of rock, soul, and folk. These early influences emerged when he taught himself to play the guitar, and stuck when he began writing his own music in 2003. Davis\'s songs blend the populist traditions of Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie with the contemporary acoustic soul of Elliott Smith and Ben Harper. It is music boiled down to an organic essence, one based on revelations and shared experience, not showboating. Davis resides in San Francisco and is currently working on his 6th independent release.  His wide range of experiences and influences keep his style fresh and steadily evolving, from catchy folk to literate acoustic rock. You\'ll feel right at home listening to his smoky, soulful voice--and you don\'t have to be from Ohio to appreciate it.

Travel | By | Skylark:

Travel | By | Skylark  is the combination of Ayo Awosika and Megan Burtt,
two singer songwriters whose styles cover the taste of even the most
eclectic of listeners.  From jazz and blues, to roots, pop and folk music,
Travel | By | Skylark is two voices painting those colors and the spaces
in between - rich in harmony and deeply rooted with soul.

The seed for Travel |  By | Skylark | was first planted when Ayo and Megan
moved to Denver, CO from Boston - planning a tour and teaching music from
their home. Playing many shows together as individual artists, they would
often collaborate, supporting each other with harmonies and their
respective instruments.  Along with encouragement from their fans, they
yearned for another musical outlet that would marry their individual
styles and push them to explore other abilities and musical styles that
were well loved, but still remained untouched.

At the 2009 Denver Post Underground Music Showcase, Ray Rinaldi remarked
"One of the best things about the UMS: hearing music in places you least
expect it. Like Sketch restaurant where Ayo Awosika and Megan Burtt
combined their talents for a set of songs that brought the crowd of wine
sippers to a standstill. In a fest full of amped up rock and progressive
takes on swift pop, Ayo and Megan laid out a laid back set that staddled,
folk, blues R&B and jazz - complete with a measured bit of scat from
Awosika. It was just two voices, a keyboard, a guitar (oh, and a
washboard), and the crowd was eating it up like the noshes on Sketch\'s
menu. A great duo in a room swank and sweet enough to accommodate their
vast skills."

This is just the beginning for the duo, as they continue to write and
prepare to record their first record around the spring of 2011.

Ginga formed nearly six years ago in Boulder, Colorado, performing a wide variety of Brazilian styles of music.  The quartet, comprised of Greg LaLiberte, Francisco Marques, Bill Kopper, and Raoul Rossiter has delved into choro, pagode, bossa nova, samba, Brazilian jazz, samba funk, and other styles. Everyone sings and everyone plays percussion. The topflight musicianship the band displays inspires people to dance, sing with the band, or sit and listen.

WadiRum was named by the band\'s leader, Stewart Erlich, after traveling for 6 months in the middle east. Wadi Rum is a region in Jordan where Erlich found himself miraculously healed after suffering a debilitating illness during his travels in the desert.

The music is much like the region: raw, powerful, silent and loud in turns, and ultimately healing.

WadiRum\'s songs build to crescendo, with lush harmony, dark, warm bass and cello, and drums that move from subtle to explosive. Each song is different, but the message is the same- the revelation of the human heart.

As a band, we try to make great music onstage and in the studio... we write our songs together, and bring our diverse backgrounds into the musical melting pot. Our strengths include using full-range dynamics, and creating songs with evocative lyrics.

We perform in and around Denver and Boulder regularly, and tend to prefer good \'listening\' venues.

Currently, we\'ve started working on creating songs for our third album, and are searching for a vocalist to replace our dear friend Jill who has moved out east...

The \'\'So, You\'re a Poet\'\' reading series by Boulder\'s \'\'beat book shop\'\' has several Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in this venerable, decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg, Bernadette Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program), Diane di Prima, Janine Pommy Vega, Anselm Hollo, and many more. The series has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters, owner of the Pearl Street landmark \'\'beat book shop.\'\'

The series was hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction to Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes \'\'One thinks of the legendary Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born, or the cafes and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement, also the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe, both in New York City\'s East Village.\'\'
The series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka, Miguel Algarin, Lewis MacAdams, and other poets read there during last year\'s Summer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary institution in the making.',
