    'description' => 'Los Angeles based People Under The Stairs, Double K (Michael Turner) and Thes One (Christopher Portugal) are the most successful fully independent hip hop duo in the history of Hip-Hop. Since their initial full length release in 1998, People Under The Stairs have performed more than a thousand sold out shows, festivals and world tours spanning 6 continents and 40 countries. With a strong DIY ethic, "The P", as they are referred to by their fans, have self managed, produced and engineered 7 full-length albums and countless singles and side projects. The musical sensibility punctuating their unique brand of hip-hop has not only earned them the title "The Steely Dan of Rap Music" but consistent critical acclaim and numerous appearances on the Billboard Charts. Their illustrious career includes an appearance on The Simpson\'s 20th Anniversary Special, a John Peele Session at Abbey Road, and groundbreaking performances at key festivals such as Glastonbury, Coachella and Bonaroo, the last of which was noted by SPIN magazine as "Simply the best performance of Friday... Period". As part of their 10 year Anniversary World Tour in 2009, People Under The Stairs travelled to new continents with sold out shows in China, Brazil and South Africa and continue to tour through 2010 as they work on their 8th Studio album. As they declared at the closing of their main stage set at the Outside Lands Festival, "We\'re the P, the ethnic Beastie Boys - and we aren\'t done. We\'re gonna\' keep bringing this party, this party rockin\' hip-hop to you when you need it. We\'ll be there."',

It\'s been their heartbeat rhythms that have inspired so much of what\'s followed since, as evidenced by the enduring popularity of the "one-drop" reggae sound. The history of the band during Marley\'s lifetime is well known. Their music has sold in excess of 250 million albums worldwide. In England alone, they\'ve notched up over twenty chart hits, including seven Top 10 entries. This was no accident. Apart from Marley, the Wailers have performed with international acts such as Sting, Stevie Wonder, Carlos Santana, as well as reggae legends Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer and Burning Spear. Their most recent collaborators include Kenny Chesney, Eve, Jason Mraz and Colbie Caillat.

Arrangements such as this show how the roots of Plant and Page\'s songwriting can be traced even further back to the roots of blues music itself. The members of AfroZep have toured and recorded with various artists, such as: Chicago Afrobeat Project, 56 Hope Road, Starrunner, 1000 Vertical Feet, the Motet, Seneke West African Drum and Dance Ensemble, among many other of gospel, big band, jazz, rock and drumming ensembles based out of Chicago. Due to the rigorous schedules of its performers, the Afro-Zep is not a full time project and the band only tours a few times a year.

After being put on at the tender age of 17 by his cousin Ice Cube, Del released two records on Elektra, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need For Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundreds of thousands, he recorded a third album, Future Development, which was never commercially released..... Del parted with Elektra and started work on the Hieroglyphics family album, 3rd Eye Vision (Hiero Imperium, 1998). Hiero went on the road and toured incessantly in support of the album for much of 1998. Del also spent a good portion of his time drawing, practicing Japanese, and playing mass amounts of video games. .... Finally ready to unleash a new record on the world, Del comes with BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN. Seventeen tracks of pure Del. He says of his work on this album I\'ve had complete control." At times, Del has felt restrained by the formulas in hip hop and the expectations fans place upon emcees who have had hits. "I wish that I had the same freedom that someone like Bjork has when she puts out an album..." Apart from collaborations with PrincePaul, El-P (Company Flow), and help from a few of his Hiero co-horts (A-plus, Casual, Domino) Del handled the majority of production on this album.....

    'description' => 'Collie Buddz, from the isle of Bermuda, has done something not impossible but something once seemingly very implausible. He\'s become the most buzz-worthy current Reggae artist over the past few years. In the summer, 2007, Collie Buddz\' Columbia Records self-titled debut album stormed the charts entering the Billboard Reggae Chart at first position. The Reggae singjay became an international star when this album then went on to debut across the world at the top of every chart from Japan to Germany. With much of the production coming from Collie himself, he delivered a solid debut with contributions from Supa Dups, Shea Taylor, Bang Out, Screwface, Bobby Konders and Crown N Kah-So-Real to name just a few. Released just a day before US Independence Day, Collie\'s debut album could be heard blasting out of car windows from Brooklyn to Kingston all summer long. Critically speaking, Collie\'s debut was a monster. Speaking of his first single, an undeniable summer anthem titled, "Come Around," Source Magazine proclaimed, "This 24 year old shotta has got an anthem spreading across the seas." "The song is a monster," claimed Miami New Times. And, Hip Hop Weekly said, "Collie Buddz is one of the most firmly grounded voices you may ever encounter." The industry excitement about this new voice in music manifested in many ways namely by inspiring Collie\'s musical peers to either create their own remixes of "Come Around," or join Collie on the official remix of the single. Everyone from Busta Rhymes, Cypress Hill and Paul Wall to G-Unit and Shaggy contributed to the anthem.',
