DESCRIPTION:FOMA:\n\nFoma's sonic palate delivers honesty that you don't he
 ar in pop music nowadays.  There's real human experience reflected in the s
 ongs\, but it's never conveyed without a sense of adventure.  The result is
  a grittiness that allows the nature of human spirit to shine through\, sca
 rs and all. It's simplicity creates a solid platform for vocalist Jace Smyk
 il's crooning blues to take flight\, while a dead-steady rhythm\, and glist
 ening guitars keep your focus where it was meant to be all along: deep in t
 he soul.  Keep your ears peeled for their new record in 2011.\n\nwww.myspac

 in greece. two friends lose their luggage. hurricanes destroy sailboats. fu
 rniture and money spill into the sea. there is no styrofoam in space. the m
 usic is kavalarian\, reminiscent of the scent of female skin in august. the
 re is a song about a russian girl\, a lock of hair\, and a promise. the pla
 y is a tragedy. sometimes you can hear the sound of ultimate suffering\, if
  you want to. upbeat... but not always. loud... but not nearly as loud as i
 t used to be. philadelphian... in that it's not angry\, we've just been mug
 ged before. positive... even though the truth still hurts sometimes. paul i
 s of greek descent\, born and raised in philadelphia\, pa. he writes the so
 ngs. mikey is some kind of special blend\, nobody really knows. born and ra
 ised in philadelphia\, pa\, he's somewhat erratic\, a two-inch fanatic\, co
 mpression abuser\, record producer. he helps paul make the songs better.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Decker:\n\n"Every song is like a prayer." So said a fan of Sedo
 na\, AZ singer-songwriter Brandon Decker\, musically known simply as\, "Dec
 ker." This is not to say that either he or his music is religious by any me
 ans\, but his songs delve into the human heart and the human condition. Not
  quite rock\, not quite folk\, his acoustic-based music draws upon a variet
 y of influences\; from Leonard Cohen to Tom Waits\, from Cat Power to PJ Ha
 rvey.\n \nDecker is a storyteller concerned with the chasm between how life
  is and how it could be. Speaking on the 2009 release of his debut album\, 
 "Long Days\," Decker said about his music\, "in every song I'm taking a mom
 ent and trying to work through it honestly and sincerely.  That‘s all I‘ve 
 got." Decker continues such work on his upcoming release\, "Long as the Nig
 ht\," which he describes as "white boy gospel" - his second release from Se
 dona independent label Mescal Porch Records. Part gospel\, part spaghetti w
 estern\, part folk rock\, the album features eerie organs\, wailing choirs\
 , and triumphant horns while bringing a larger\, fuller band sound than his
  debut. "It's all about surrounding yourself with good people - musicians\,
  friends\, and family\," said Decker regarding the fuller arrangement on th
 e new album.\n \nHaving successfully completed a 4-state\, 34-show west coa
 st tour in the winter of 2009-2010 in support of "Long Days\," Decker will 
 begin touring again in the fall of 2010 to support the album's release.\n\n

 keeping pop forms and melodies\, while at the same time using jazz harmonie

 per\, trying (at times unsuccessfully) not to fall into patches of prickly 
 pear. Now\, he’s got the ears for roots music. Hopping effortlessly from fi
 ngerpicking to mandolin\, clawhammer banjo to lap slide guitar\, Cahalen’s 
 writing encompasses everything from punchy political commentaries\, to soul
  warming serenades\, branching out into instrumental rags and fiddle tunes\
 , yet still retaining his subtle musical signature. Joining Cahalen will be
  flatpicker\, octave mandolin & clawhammer banjo player extraordinaire\, El

DESCRIPTION:Teresa Storch:\n\nShow most people a swirly Dave Matthews Band 
 poster and what do they see? Teresa Storch saw her calling. While studying 
 engineering at the Colorado School of Mines she got hooked on the live musi
 c scene. One show at Red Rocks prompted her to say out loud “I want to do t
 hat!” When a friend joked\, “Do you think you missed your calling?\,” “Mayb
 e?”\nwas her reply. However\, a little voice in her head kept prompting her
  to start writing and performing her own music. Now\, years later\, she's e
 ncouraging others to follow their own voice with her contagious smile and m
 oving lyrics. Audience members say it's like seeing Bonnie Raitt or Greg Br
 own when they first started. She connects like she's known\nyou forever and
  inhabits her songs so fully you can't help but be drawn in. Storch has tou
 red 33 states over four years\, bringing her soulful roots-pop to bars\, co
 ffeehouses\, living rooms and cafes\, and becoming\, along the way\, a live
  performer of joyful strength and\nriveting\, emotional power.\n\nwww.teres

 e ''So\, You're a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' has
  several Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in
  this venerable\, decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Bern
 adette Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Pro
 gram)\, Diane di Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more. 
 The series has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Pe
 ters\, owner of the Pearl Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe serie
 s was hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduct
 ion to Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legend
 ary Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the
  cafes and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\,
  also the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East 
 Village.''\nThe series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffe
 ehouse\, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, M
 iguel Algarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last yea
 r's Summer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary 
 institution in the making.

DESCRIPTION:Jared Bartman: \n\nThere is an old photograph of Jared Bartman\
 , age two\, standing in shorts\, a blazer and a bow-tie\, wildly strumming 
 a child-sized plastic guitar. In the years that followed\, Jared’s musical 
 repertoire grew to include piano\, accordion\, and mandolin. Primarily inﬂu
 enced by gypsy-tinged bands like Beirut and Devotchka\, Jared merges genres
  to create a sound that is all his own\, combining Eastern European folk wi
 th classical arrangements and occasionally returning to his more blues- bas
 ed roots. His versatility is best noted by his ability to create songs that
  vary from darkly dramatic to fast-paced fusions of accordion and middle-ea
 stern melody. Today\, his live shows span from solo performances to large e
 nsembles\, with percussionist Aaron Kavelman using everything from bundt ca
 ke pans ﬁlled with water to hollowed out World War II bombshells to recreat
 e the vivid sonic pictures captured in their studio recordings. Sharing the
  stage with artists like John Vanderslice\, Richard Buckner and Southeast E
 ngine has allowed Jared to perform for audiences that value a richer\, raw 
 sound accompanied by lyrical poeticism. He is currently supporting his late
 st release\, Jersey Shore\, with shows throughout the Midwest and East Coas
 t. A series of 7-inch records will see a limited vinyl release early next y
 ear. \n\nwww.JaredBartman.com\n\nDastardly:\n\nThe marriage between old wes
 t folk and the ambiguous genre of “indie rock” makes the songs of Dastardly
  a palatable playlist for those who aren’t normally attracted to cowboy cro
 oners. In fact\, by the sound of the screaming girls heard at Subterranean\
 , we’re pretty sure the band was responsible for converting quite a few pop
  princesses into banjo loving broads. Experimental enough to feel fresh but
  traditional enough to feel familiar even to\nfirst timers\, Dastardly is b
 and that asserted itself as notable early in the game and now can enjoy the
  steady rise to local fame they’re guaranteed.\n\nwww.dastardlytheband.com

 ation of smooth melodies\, latin rhythms and progressive rock intoxicates t
 he soul.  Using a unique song writing style infused with complex chords and
  intricate melodies\, Webb’s musical prowess now extends beyond the traditi
 onal label of singer songwriter.\n\nA graduate of CU-Boulder’s School of Mu
 sic Webb’s musical accomplishments include sharing marquees with  Five for 
 Fighting\, Sister Hazel\, Leftover Salmon and Louden Wainwright III. He has
  received airtime on many stations including live performances on Denver’s 
 99.5 the Mountain and 97.3 KBCO Studio C Sessions and appeared on 9 News De

 Skylark:\n\nTravel | By | Skylark  is the combination of Ayo Awosika and Me
 gan Burtt\, \ntwo singer songwriters whose styles cover the taste of even t
 he most\neclectic of listeners.  From jazz and blues\, to roots\, pop and f
 olk music\,\nTravel | By | Skylark is two voices painting those colors and 
 the spaces\nin between - rich in harmony and deeply rooted with soul.\n\nTh
 e seed for Travel |  By | Skylark | was first planted when Ayo and Megan\nm
 oved to Denver\, CO from Boston - planning a tour and teaching music from\n
 their home. Playing many shows together as individual artists\, they would\
 noften collaborate\, supporting each other with harmonies and their\nrespec
 tive instruments.  Along with encouragement from their fans\, they\nyearned
  for another musical outlet that would marry their individual\nstyles and p
 ush them to explore other abilities and musical styles that\nwere well love
 d\, but still remained untouched.\n\nAt the 2009 Denver Post Underground Mu
 sic Showcase\, Ray Rinaldi remarked\n"One of the best things about the UMS:
  hearing music in places you least\nexpect it. Like Sketch restaurant where
  Ayo Awosika and Megan Burtt\ncombined their talents for a set of songs tha
 t brought the crowd of wine\nsippers to a standstill. In a fest full of amp
 ed up rock and progressive\ntakes on swift pop\, Ayo and Megan laid out a l
 aid back set that staddled\,\nfolk\, blues R&B and jazz – complete with a m
 easured bit of scat from\nAwosika. It was just two voices\, a keyboard\, a 
 guitar (oh\, and a\nwashboard)\, and the crowd was eating it up like the no
 shes on Sketch’s\nmenu. A great duo in a room swank and sweet enough to acc
 ommodate their\nvast skills."\n\nThis is just the beginning for the duo\, a
 s they continue to write and\nprepare to record their first record around t
 he spring of 2011.\n\n-----

DESCRIPTION:Kris Drickey:\n\nKris Drickey's first words were the lyrics to 
 her first songs. Not long after she learned to walk she picked up the violi
 n and began to play. Denver folk music luminary David Rynhart describes Kri

 , Missouri\, where she sang in choir\, oozed over her love for musical thea
 tre and pop divas like Sarah McLachlan\, and took to the musical nature of 
 her grandfather who was always singing. The power behind Kendra’s voice tra
 nsmits energy from another realm and penetrates down to the blood.  She sin
 gs straight to the heart\, crafting lyrics and melodies that speak to the s
 oul’s journey and touch the raw human emotion that moves through us all. Sh
 e has continued to hone her style by writing songs that bridge many worlds 
 and genres\, with the proverbial stamp of a true singer/songwriter. “Listen
 ing to Kendra sing is like listening to an angel whispering directly into m
 y ears. Her magical words and mystical voice move me tears every time. I ex
 perience deep transformation from her songs!” ~Beverlee Garb\, CO You can c
 heck out some demos of her early work at www.kendracurrent.com. Stay tuned

DESCRIPTION:Abby Ahmad:\n\nWith edgy\, intelligent lyrics and hypnotic melo
 dies\, NYC-based Abby Ahmad's music is as passionate as it is profound. Bri
 dging genres of folk-rock\, blues\, and alternative\, Abby's percussive gui
 tar style and arresting vocals captivate and challenge her audiences. Emoti
 onally-charged\, yet playful\, she is at once in your face and in your hear
 t. Curriculum\, (the follow-up to her acclaimed debut album\, The Rearview)
 \, marks a metaphoric and musical evolution for the 28-year old songwriter.
  Inspired by the thrilling yet frenetic challenges of being an emerging mus
 ician in NYC\, Curriculum documents the path to independence (both musical 
 and personal) navigating the many lessons learned along the way. The album’
 s production values were crafted with a similar mentality. Abby teamed up w
 ith Brooklyn-based producers Mark Marshall and Nathan Rosenberg. Together\,
  they have produced an organic\, searing portrait of sound and emotion. Add
 ing to the album’s sonic maturity and authenticity are a stellar lineup of 
 NY musicians including the horn section of legendary musician Levon Helm an
 d Grammy award winning multi-instrumentalist\, Michael Leonhart. With integ
 rity\, guts\, and skill\, Abby Ahmad breaks new ground in the realm of inde
 pendent music.\n\n"Abby Ahmad is one of those rare talents who is at the id
 eal position in her artistic journey when craft\, skill and talent have all
  developed to an equal point and coalesced into a magnificent apex of achie
 vement. Her latest album\, CURRICULUM\, is easily on par with the works of 
 Dylan and Dickinson or even Plath."\n-Allen Foster\, Songwriter's Monthly\n

DESCRIPTION:''So\, You're a Poet\,'' presents:  David Barsamian\n\nThe ''So
 \, You're a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' has sever
 al Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in this 
 venerable\, decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Bernadette
  Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program)\
 , Diane di Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more. The se
 ries has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters\,
  owner of the Pearl Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe series was 
 hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction to
  Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legendary Ca
 baret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the cafes
  and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\, also 
 the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East Villag
 e.''\nThe series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse
 \, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Miguel 
 Algarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last year's Su
 mmer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary instit
 ution in the making.

DESCRIPTION:Steve Hoffman and the Organic Roots:\n\nSinger songwriter Steve
 n Michael Hoffman grew up on the East Coast during the influential ‘60s and

 d up the music of the Beatles\, Stones\, Moody Blues\, Loggins & Messina\, 
 Crosby Stills Nash & Young\, John Denver\, and also Stevie Wonder\, Marvin 
 Gaye\, Supremes and the Temptations. His Texas friends introduced him to Jo

 k Bartley of Firefall fame\, the late Jeffrey Edge\, noted guitarist with W

 ric instruments and vocal harmonies\, Hoffman’s original music reflects gro
 wing up in an American cultural stew of rock\, country\, blues\, R&B\, jazz
  and funk. With themes including love won and lost\, the pursuit of the Ame
 rican Dream\, and the promise of the open road\, Hoffman’s songs strive to

 f traditional music\, the duo draws heavily from Irish\, Scandinavian and A
 merican dance music (like\, fiddle tunes) while incorporating modern influe
 nces and dynamic\, high-energy interplay. Ruby Horse Thief successfully com
 bines the modern and traditional in the format of a fiddle/guitar duo- with

 ms\, put on a packed CD release show in Denver\, and embarked on a solo tou
 r of New England.\n\nRyan Drickey is a freelance violinist/fiddler and sing
 er\, known for his subtle and expressive touch. His influences range from t

  to the wild intricacies of American Jazz. While remaining deeply respectfu
 l of the traditions from which he has learned\, Ryan brings his own musical
  language into everything he plays.\n\nRyan can be often be heard playing c

DESCRIPTION:Shannon Curtis:\n\nWhen Shannon Curtis was 5\, she danced and s
 ang along to her dad playing 40’s-era standards on her family’s baby grand.
  When she was 7\, her classical piano teacher told her she played like a bo
 y. When she was 9\, she sang into her hairbrush pretending to be Amy Grant.
  Just out of college\, she shirked her pre-med Biology degree and made an e
 arnest effort as the lead singer in a guitar-based rock band. Three years a
 go she found her piano again\, started writing love songs\, and quit the ba
 nd. Since then she says it’s been like walking around in an old\, comfortab
 le pair of shoes – playing the piano and singing songs about love. The Los 
 Angeles Times describes Shannon as "... a beautiful piano player who sounds
  like the love child of Fiona Apple and Norah Jones." Shannon's debut EP\, 
 Boomerangs & Seesaws\, was released in July 2007 on the tiny Saint Cloud Re
 cords label\, and the follow up\, Paris Can't Have You\, was released in Ma
 rch 2008. Constant touring and placements in TV and film have been building
  Shannon a devoted following across the country.\n\nwww.myspace.com/shannon

DESCRIPTION:''So\, You're a Poet\,'' presents KEROUAC MEMORIAL READING:\n\n
 The ''So\, You're a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' h
 as several Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed 
 in this venerable\, decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Be
 rnadette Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing P
 rogram)\, Diane di Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more
 . The series has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom 
 Peters\, owner of the Pearl Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe ser
 ies was hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introdu
 ction to Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the lege
 ndary Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or t
 he cafes and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement
 \, also the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's Eas
 t Village.''\nThe series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Cof
 feehouse\, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\,
  Miguel Algarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last y
 ear's Summer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literar
 y institution in the making.

DESCRIPTION:Ben Hanna:\n\n"I had a skateboard\, a Playstation (with a mod c
 hip\, if you're cool enough to know what that is)\, and a guitar. All the t
 oys a suburban only child would hope for\, and likely receive growing up in
  the upper middle class suburbs of Detroit during the Clinton years (MTV wa
 s even cool). I was a wanna be watered down punk rocker in 1999\, an indie 
 rocker in 2000\, an emo kid in 2001\, and a wanna be watered down metal hea
 d in 2002. I tried pot in 2003 and started listening to Bob Dylan\, Jimi He
 ndrix\, The Beatles\, and other classics I had missed out on during the ons
 et of puberty. At this point\, my best friends father\, an avid record coll
 ector who lived two doors down from me gave me an album\; "Townes Van Zandt
 - Live at the Old Quarter". It sat in my cd book full of burned cds for mon
 ths\, next to The Getup Kids\, NOFX\, Screeching Weasel\, and other choice 
 discs that helped me find it. Finally\, I got bored on an airplane and popp
 ed it in my Disc Man (remember those?) circa 2003 on a flight from Detroit 
 to Colorado\, where I was soon to live. In this disc\, which I had heard ma
 ny times before\, I heard something different. It was extraordinarily ordin
 ary\; a man\, just one man who transcended the "singer/ songwriter" genre t
 o earnestly tell the story of his life experience through the template of a
  song. As Lou Reed put it\, (to paraphrase) "I'm an artist\, the music is j
 ust one aspect of what I do". Granted\, Townes' sound was very characterist
 ic of his time and location\, but there was something completely abstract a
 nd brilliant in his music I had never heard before... A certain "sentiment"
  I suppose. I realized the artist defines the genre\, not the other way aro
 und. Not being skilled enough to learn any cover song and actually do it ju
 stice\, I set out on a quest to find a compromise that included my love of 
 music\, my desire to play it\, and my basic guitar skills. Thus\, I wrote m
 y first song. Its been a journey ever since. .."\n\nwww.myspace.com/benjami

DESCRIPTION:The Littlest Birds:\n\nThe Littlest Birds come from the Eastern
  Sierra of California. A land of big mountains\, vast deserts\, and small t
 owns spread along a single highway. They play a lot of original folk music 
 inspired by this landscape and written by cellist David Huebner\, balanced 
 with a healthy dose of old time clawhammer banjo music by Sharon Martinson.
   You'll be surprised by the warmth and depth of sound created by the cello
  and banjo arrangment\, which provides the perfect foundation for their smo
 oth vocal harmonies. There is music to dance to\, and music to relax to\, b
 ut mostly you'll just want to listen.\n\nwww.littlestbirds.net

 'm sure has been taken down\; but in my heart that fire ring\, the laughing
 \, and the singing are alive as could be. This is were i learned how to fly
 . Today i sit around playing my own songs\, and instead of my mom strumming
  the guitar\, its me. I like to think i have a sound all my own although so
 me friends in the audience have mentioned that i sound like Jewel\, Emi Lou
  Harris or Buffy Saint Marie. What inspires me most about playing and liste
 ning to music is the expression of the heart\; Pouring oneself into the son

 ded me a dollar bill and on it was some beautiful lettering reading "Passio

 here is nothing greater then sharing a moment of authentic bliss.\n

 is the next step toward dominating the Austin singer-songwriter scene and b
 eyond. Songs like "Ben" and "Low Down" will cause thoughtful foot-tapping a
 t every listen\, and "All Night" is a stunning track that is featured in th

 c Forsyth is a local\, Boulder-based singer-songwriter\, launching his bran
 d new EP "The Thin of Thick Things" at the Laughing Goat. His soulful music
  has been described as "Folk-Pop gone horribly right" and his following has
  grown steadily since the release of his 2008 album "Trees and Other Shady 
 Things." Eric has played with some of Colorado's best artists and venues si
 nce making the move to the Front Range in 2007. Prior to his Boulder days h
 e wrote music\, collaborated and performed in California\, Idaho\, Michigan
 \, Pennsylvania\, Miami\, and even Germany. \n\nwww.ericforsythmusic.com\n\
 nTravel by Skylark:\n\nTravel by Skylark is the combination of Ayo Awosika 
 and Megan Burtt\, \ntwo singer songwriters whose styles cover the taste of 
 even the most\neclectic of listeners.  From jazz and blues\, to roots\, pop
  and folk music\,\nTravel by Skaylark is two voices painting those colors a
 nd the spaces\nin between - rich in harmony and deeply rooted with soul.\n\
 nThe seed for Travel by Skylark was first planted when Ayo and Megan\nmoved
  to Denver\, CO from Boston - planning a tour and teaching music from\nthei
 r home. Playing many shows together as individual artists\, they would\noft
 en collaborate\, supporting each other with harmonies and their\nrespective
  instruments.  Along with encouragement from their fans\, they\nyearned for
  another musical outlet that would marry their individual\nstyles and push 
 them to explore other abilities and musical styles that\nwere well loved\, 
 but still remained untouched.\n\nAt the 2009 Denver Post Underground Music 
 Showcase\, Ray Rinaldi remarked\n"One of the best things about the UMS: hea
 ring music in places you least\nexpect it. Like Sketch restaurant where Ayo
  Awosika and Megan Burtt\ncombined their talents for a set of songs that br
 ought the crowd of wine\nsippers to a standstill. In a fest full of amped u
 p rock and progressive\ntakes on swift pop\, Ayo and Megan laid out a laid 
 back set that staddled\,\nfolk\, blues R&B and jazz – complete with a measu
 red bit of scat from\nAwosika. It was just two voices\, a keyboard\, a guit
 ar (oh\, and a\nwashboard)\, and the crowd was eating it up like the noshes
  on Sketch’s\nmenu. A great duo in a room swank and sweet enough to accommo
 date their\nvast skills."\n\nThis is just the beginning for the duo\, as th
 ey continue to write and\nprepare to record their first record around the s
 pring of 2011.

DESCRIPTION:Sharaya Mikael:\n\nPortland resident Sharaya Mikael may be new 
 to the local music scene\, but when it comes to gaining a following this ar
 tist is not wasting any time. Continually\, her tantalizing vocals prove to
 o irresistible for even the most unsuspecting passer-by. At an open door ve
 nue her voice migrates to the sidewalk and not a single pedestrian can resi
 st a double-take\; many of them turn around and come inside. Her sound is s
 iren-like.\n\nA perfect match to her tender disposition\, her lyrics are re
 freshingly sweet. The epitome of vulnerability\, she speaks frankly to the 
 complexities of relationships that no twenty-something—or anyone else for t
 hat matter—can escape. Her lyrics are warm and inviting. Like a friendly hu
 g\, a supportive pat on the back\, her tunes seem to whisper\, “I understan
 d…its okay.” This artist is practical\, accessible\, but also delightfully 
 fresh.\n\nAs gentle as Carly Simon and bold as Aimee Mann\, Sharaya has bee
 n compared by her fans to the contemporary artists Ingrid Michelson and Sar
 ah Bareilles. This fair comparison speaks perhaps most vividly to the warmt
 h of her melodies\, to her rolling\, sweeping musical stride. Sharaya’s lat
 est single Far Field calls listeners—both musically and lyrically—to the ro
 ller-coaster of the lovesick\, to memory’s involuntary ride.\n\nWhere her r
 eputation does not yet precede her\, raw talent certainly does. In any venu
 e\, at any time of day\, this artist seizes audiences effortlessly with und
 erstated but rich vocal tones that are not only provoking\, but that also a
 ct as this city’s soundtrack\, background music for the green and the gray.

DESCRIPTION:Benefit for the Bush Medicine Partnership (www.bushmedicinepart
 nership.org)\nRay Francis\, Joseph Calitri and Ava Celeste\n\nAnd...here's 
 what the Benefit is all about:\n\nIn hospitals throughout Cameroon\, patien
 ts must pay upfront for all medical services\, including life threatening e
 mergencies. Thankfully\, many hospitals will admit emergency maternity case
 s without prior payment if surgery is needed to save the life of the woman 
 or infant. However\, after the caesarian delivery\, the woman and her infan
 t are not permitted to leave the hospital until the bill is paid. As a resu
 lt\, at any one tim...e\, there are several women who live for weeks to mon
 ths on the cement floor of the hospital ward with their infants as they rec
 over from traumatic surgery and arrange to borrow from family and friends t
 he $200-$250 they need to be allowed to go home. \n\nThis situation becomes
  dire for a group of very vulnerable young women who unable to find the mon
 ey for the bill. Usually\, these women are less than 20 years old and not m
 arried. Therefore\, the fathers of the babies do not show up to help with t
 he bill\, often because they are already married or the pregnancy is a resu
 lt of rape. In addition to being unmarried\, these women usually do not hav
 e living immediate family members\, the primary means of “social insurance”
  throughout the country. \n\n100% of donations will be used to pay the medi
 cal bills of these women. Cameroonian surgeon Dr. George Bwelle with the he
 lp of Drexel Medical School students will personally deliver the payment to
  the hospital Bursar.\n\nThank you for your interest and support in this pr
 oject\, \n\nBush Medicine Partnership\nwww.bushmedicinepartnership.org\n

DESCRIPTION:Lindsay Meredith:\n\nBefore Lindsay Meredith knew much about an
 ything\, one thing she knew was that she was born to sing. As she puts it\,
  "I've always carried around this intense feeling that this was what I was 
 meant to do with my life. I don't know where the feeling came from and I do
 n't remember when it began. I just know that I can't remember a single mome
 nt in my life when I didn't feel this way. I never had a choice in what I w
 ould pursue\; singing pursued me and that was it." But she wouldn’t have it
  any other way. With a vocal style that sounds like a mix of Chrissie Hynde
  from the Pretenders\, PJ Harvey and Norah Jones\, she’s gaining well-deser
 ved enthusiastic reviews wherever she plays\, from The Meadowlark to Michel
 angelo’s Wine Bar. Becoming the performer she is now\, however\, didn’t hap
 pen overnight. Now living in Denver\, Lindsay decided a few years back to b
 ecome a Professional Singer. While honing her natural gift\, she picked up 
 guitar to allow herself the opportunity to perform publicly. She also began
  to write her own songs to “try something new” and express herself in way s
 he felt she “wouldn’t necessarily be able to with someone else’s songs”. In
  early 2009\, after spending several months as a solo musician performing a
 round town\, Lindsay became a vocalist for The Fever\, a successful\, local
  band. Since then\, the group gained enough attention that it became necess
 ary to form another band in order to accommodate events. Lindsay now fronts
  "3rd Degree" as their Lead Vocalist\, as well as continuing to perform wit
 h original group. Her main focus\, however\, is continuing her successful\,
  solo\, acoustic act. This stage in her life and in her music is\, “the mos
 t fulfilling yet…I can’t wait to see what else happens down the road”. Catc
 h Lindsay and her voice around the Denver area this summer. \n\nwww.myspace

  before the hype\, there was the traveling folk singer. Woody Guthrie\, Ram
 blin Jack\, Leadbelly\, and others traveled the country armed with nothing 
 but a guitar and a head full of songs. And while the tradition has long bee
 n shadowed by the ever growing music industry\, the folk singer is still ou
 t there. John Craigie is one. Doing his best to keep the tradition alive\, 
 he travels from town to town\, telling stories and singing songs. Some nigh
 ts to a crowded house\, some nights for two people. His songs and stories c
 over the spectrum of human emotion. Some funny\, some sad\, some bitter and
  some sweet. With his roots style\, Craigie has been gaining a cult followi
 ng throughout the country. Despite the lack of any of the tools of the mode
 rn aggressively popular musician\, his music continues to spread. \n\nThere
  will be no hype\, no exaggeration. No blurb from some magazine/person youv
 e never heard of telling you what "next thing" he is. No pushy manager tell
 ing you to go out to the shows. Just the music and the performances. We'll 
 see you out on the road. \n\nwww.myspace.com/johncraigie

DESCRIPTION:Mike Mangione & The Union w/ Dave Tamkin:\n\nSomewhere between 
 indie and folk\, between poetry and introspective musings\, one finds Teneb
 rae\, whose title -- Latin for shadows -- perfectly sums up the feel of thi
 s set. The album revolves around relationships and the emotions that feed a
 nd sap them\, of those who want out\, those who want in\, and those who are
  torn between leaving and staying. Conflict between lovers is the set's the
 matic crux\, the "Great Divide" that Mike Mangione is forever attempting to
  bestride\, the details of which are mostly sketchy\, but the repercussions
  and emotions they evoke as sharp as glass. And it's those emotions that wa
 sh strongest over the set\, although the lyrics linger. Like all good poetr
 y\, one's meant to luxuriate in the beauty of their structure\, the lovely 
 twist of the words\, and the hidden meanings occasionally found within. The
  music provides plenty of scope to immerse oneself in the vocals\; it's a s
 ublime backdrop that provides support for\, but never overshadows\, the lyr
 ics. The warmth of the sound\, the shadowed melodies\, the rhythms that add
  urgency to the words\, and the depths of mood the strings subtly add\, all
  feed the pensive air of the set. A sublime album to be enjoyed at leisure\
 , a late night pleasure or rainy afternoon delight. ~ Jo-Ann Greene\, All M

 make-believe had turned into the real deal. He’s been playing ever since. G
 lenn’s early experiences as a musician focused on rock music\, including a 
 stint with the popular Connecticut jam band\,  Fountain Project.\nA Tommy E
 mmanuel concert changed everything. After seeing the master guitarist perfo
 rm in 2002\, Glenn changed focus and began composing and playing fingerstyl
 e guitar exclusively. Influenced both by talented fingerstyle artists such 
 as Emmanuel\, Michael Hedges\, and Preston Reid and the bombast and melodic
 ism of bands like Tool and 311\, Glenn has developed a style of solo acoust
 ic guitar playing that’s uniquely his own: aggressive\, emotional\, vibrant
 \, melodic\, in turn and often within the same song. Anyone who has marvele
 d at Glenn’s brilliant acoustic interpretation of Iron Maiden’s Run to the 
 Hills\, a YouTube hit and a tribute to those early days of air-guitar\, can
  attest to Glenn’s imaginative and virtuosic guitar playing.\nGlenn perform
 s regularly throughout the Tristate area and and has toured in support of h
 is two releases to date: 2005’s Innovations and 2007’s Busker\, named for G
 lenn’s experiences as a musician in New York City’s “Music Under New York” 
 program\, in which Glenn performs in NYC subway stations and other transpor
 tation centers. A highly anticipated new CD is slated for release in 2010.\
 nGlenn has performed with many national acts\, including Don Ross\, Tuck an

 hout the New Haven area and also teaches budding guitar players at A Sound 
 Choice in Branford Connecticut. \n\nwww.glennroth.com

 had a skateboard\, a Playstation (with a mod chip\, if you're cool enough t
 o know what that is)\, and a guitar. All the toys a suburban only child wou
 ld hope for\, and likely receive growing up in the upper middle class subur
 bs of Detroit during the Clinton years (MTV was even cool). I was a wanna b
 e watered down punk rocker in 1999\, an indie rocker in 2000\, an emo kid i
 n 2001\, and a wanna be watered down metal head in 2002. I tried pot in 200
 3 and started listening to Bob Dylan\, Jimi Hendrix\, The Beatles\, and oth
 er classics I had missed out on during the onset of puberty. At this point\
 , my best friends father\, an avid record collector who lived two doors dow
 n from me gave me an album\; "Townes Van Zandt- Live at the Old Quarter". I
 t sat in my cd book full of burned cds for months\, next to The Getup Kids\
 , NOFX\, Screeching Weasel\, and other choice discs that helped me find it.
  Finally\, I got bored on an airplane and popped it in my Disc Man (remembe
 r those?) circa 2003 on a flight from Detroit to Colorado\, where I was soo
 n to live. In this disc\, which I had heard many times before\, I heard som
 ething different. It was extraordinarily ordinary\; a man\, just one man wh
 o transcended the "singer/ songwriter" genre to earnestly tell the story of
  his life experience through the template of a song. As Lou Reed put it\, (
 to paraphrase) "I'm an artist\, the music is just one aspect of what I do".
  Granted\, Townes' sound was very characteristic of his time and location\,
  but there was something completely abstract and brilliant in his music I h
 ad never heard before... A certain "sentiment" I suppose. I realized the ar
 tist defines the genre\, not the other way around. Not being skilled enough
  to learn any cover song and actually do it justice\, I set out on a quest 
 to find a compromise that included my love of music\, my desire to play it\
 , and my basic guitar skills. Thus\, I wrote my first song. Its been a jour
 ney ever since. .."\n\nwww.myspace.com/benjaminnolanhanna\n\n--------------

 , which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Miguel A
 lgarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last year's Sum

 h songs almost too revealing for lovers\, Boulder singer-songwriter Kate Ja
 worski creates music that is both personal and impactful. A deep understand

 nvincing. Poured out over the subtle and intricate textures of her able ban
 d\, graceful melodies alternately stimulate and soothe - giving voice to th
 e harmony and conflict that are inseparable components of passionate human 
 experience. Influences from folk\, jazz\, and classical styles come togethe

DESCRIPTION:''So\, You're a Poet\,'' presents: Patrick Ohslund and Dre John
 son. from SF\n\nThe ''So\, You're a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''be
 at book shop'' has several Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who
  have performed in this venerable\, decades-old series include the late All
 en Ginsberg\, Bernadette Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the 
 Summer Writing Program)\, Diane di Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo
 \, and many more. The series has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac Sch
 ool alumnus Tom Peters\, owner of the Pearl Street landmark ''beat book sho
 p.'' \n\nThe series was hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe
 . In the introduction to Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One th
 inks of the legendary Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement
  was born\, or the cafes and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat L
 iterary Movement\, also the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New
  York City's East Village.''\nThe series currently takes place in the new L
 aughing Goat Coffeehouse\, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane
 . Amiri Baraka\, Miguel Algarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read the
 re during last year's Summer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a
  Boulder literary institution in the making.

DESCRIPTION:Marc Cogman:\n\nI was born in the capital city\, three days bef
 ore the shuttle went into space. Raised on the east coast by both parents i
 n a house full of siblings. I wanted to play guitar after I saw “Johnny B. 
 Goode” in Back to the Future\, but I was not yet indulged. So it was a spin
 et piano & lessons & Xmas carols & lots of Motown on the radio. A pleasant 
 life\, for certain\, but no one gets to stay a child forever. So I grew & g
 rew and I'd stopped plunking on the spinet but by then I finally had a guit
 ar & somewhere to plug it in. Then\, in my old soul adolescence\, I began t
 o speak. There was music\, yes\, but so much more\, there were words floodi
 ng out. So this became my mission. I began building a history\, in the base
 ment rooms crammed full of instruments\, on the shoddy stages of YMCAs & bl
 ock parties. In a smoky home studio an old producer showed me the ropes. He
 re was the way to sing in the mic. Here was how to better hear the pitch\; 
 one headphone off the ear. And the words & the music kept coming\, faster &
  faster. In Boston I met the guys who could keep up & pull me higher than I
 'd ever been able to go. There were vast experiments in noise & violence. I
  learned the endurance\, the grind of vans & stages & the sweaty ritual of 
 rehearsal\, until the instruments became one instrument\, until it all spok
 e the words with one voice. When the grey city thawed for a 5th time I went
  west\, in the direction of so many seekers\, to California. I befriended p
 oets & artists & filmmakers. From my home by the sea I devised a new path t
 o follow. For the 1st time I took the stages alone. I drove highway miles &
  learned to play harp & cut my hair & had my heart broken\, all in a torrid
  few months. In fall 2006\, I committed these tales to song & called it Wel
 come to the Danger Show. I carried a lot of history into those 10 songs\, s
 o it's hard to for me to imagine that it's been over 3 years now & Danger S
 how was just the tip of the icy iceberg. In 2010\, it’s all about the road.
  I’ll see you out there.\n\nwww.reverbnation.com/marcmcogman

 y turning their focus away from jazz and towards mainstream popular music. 
 In the process these young men have honed in a sound that has brought odd m

 rizing grooves. After learning from and performing with some of the greates
 t musicians alive today\, (Danilo Perez\, Ron Miles\, Ben Monder\, Mark Fer

  Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legendary Ca
 baret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the cafes
  and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\, also 
 the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East Villag
 e.''\nThe series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse
 \, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Miguel 
 Algarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last year's Su
 mmer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary instit
 ution in the making.

DESCRIPTION:WadiRum:\n\nWadiRum was named by the band's leader\, Stewart Er
 lich\, after traveling for 6 months in the middle east. Wadi Rum is a regio
 n in Jordan where Erlich found himself miraculously healed after suffering 
 a debilitating illness during his travels in the desert. \n\nThe music is m
 uch like the region: raw\, powerful\, silent and loud in turns\, and ultima
 tely healing. \n\nWadiRum's songs build to crescendo\, with lush harmony\, 
 dark\, warm bass and cello\, and drums that move from subtle to explosive. 
 Each song is different\, but the message is the same- the revelation of the
  human heart. \n\nAs a band\, we try to make great music onstage and in the
  studio... we write our songs together\, and bring our diverse backgrounds 
 into the musical melting pot. Our strengths include using full-range dynami
 cs\, and creating songs with evocative lyrics. \n\nWe perform in and around
  Denver and Boulder regularly\, and tend to prefer good 'listening' venues.
  \n\nCurrently\, we've started working on creating songs for our third albu
 m\, and are searching for a vocalist to replace our dear friend Jill who ha
 s moved out east...\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/wadirum\n

DESCRIPTION:Lingonberry Jam:\n\nLingonberry Jam is a new name for an old pa
 rtnership in music.  Goril Ramo Haave and Julane Lund have played Norwegian
  traditional music together since 2002\, when Julane became neighbors with 
 Goril near the small campus of the folk music program for Telemark Universi
 ty College\, in Rauland\, Norway.  Due to the music school and the rich tra
 dition of honoring folk music in the province of Telemark\, nightly jam ses
 sions with Goril\, Julane\, and many other musicians often took place.  Ove
 r that time\, Julane and Goril became good friends as well as musical colla
 borators.  \nGoril\, originally from Trondelag\, Norway\, is listed in the 
 “Who’s Who” book of Norwegian folk musicians for her skill at playing the l
 angeleik\, a type of Norwegian dulcimer.  She has made recordings and perfo
 rmed with one of the most famous folk singers in Norway: Agnes Buen Garnaas
 .  Besides playing the langeleik\, Goril performs guitar\, flute\, piano\, 
 and she sings.  \nJulane Lund was born in Wisconsin to a very musical Norwe
 gian-American family.  It came natural to her then to play both Norwegian-A
 merican fiddle music as well as classical violin.  She has played in orches
 tras in the United States and Russia\, and she holds a master degree in fid
 dling from Telemark University College in Norway.  She performs on the eigh
 t stringed\, highly ornamented Norwegian Hardanger fiddle\, as well as the 
 conventional violin\, and she sings in Norwegian and English.  She has won 
 numerous awards for her fiddling in both Norway and the U.S.\nLingonberry J
 am provides a unique blend of Norwegian and American music\, both from trad
 itional and contemporary sources.  Much of the music is what Norwegian immi
 grants in the U.S. created based on their existence as Norwegians in an Eng
 lish speaking nation.  Some songs are traditionally Norwegian\, but with En
 glish text.  Others are sung in Norwegian but they sound distinctly America
 n.  The Norwegian experience of America is also reflected by the band in fr
 esh new compositions and arrangements.  \n\nwww.julanelund.com

  open mics and obtaining local shows in the small restaurants and venues in

 ained a small fan-base at home and continued to write and perform.\nEarning
  scholarships to a local community college\, J.L. attended school as a musi

 ated to the Denver metropolitan area to focus on his songwriting and the pu
 blic spotlight.\nCurrently\, he resides in the Denver area and continues to
  promote his music and looks towards performance and expanding the fan base
 .\nHis primary influences include David Gray\, Ellis Paul\, Bob Dylan\, Joh
 n Gorka and Matt Nathanson.  His style of performance covers a broad base o
 f folk music and contemporary Rock/Pop.  \n\nhttp://jlbaker.net

DESCRIPTION:The Sam Yulsman Group:\n\nThe Sam Yulsman Trio in its one night
  engagement at The Laughing Goat\nhopes to hip Denver to their unique blend
  of 1960’s post bop\, post\nexpressionist conceptualism\, Gospel music\, an
 d Americana.  Drummer\nMike Piolet\, a Chicago native\, brings his schoolin
 g in the Gospel\nchurch to bear\, with a beastly mastery of the kit.  Saxop
 honist Danny\nMeyer\, a Boulder native\, continues to explore the outer har
 monic and\nrhythmic boundaries of jazz improvisation and composition.  Pian
 ist\nSam Yulsman\, who is making the move to New York City this August\,\nb
 rings a fascination with ethnic music from the Middle East\, and a\ndeep-ro
 oted love of Americana to the table.  With a new book of\ncompositions focu
 sing on post expressionist conceptualism\, Yulsman\nhopes to build on past 
 successes\, such as his work on Tapestry\nRecords’ “Thirteen Channels”— a C
 D that Edward Blanco of ejazznews.com\nhails as “clever” and “engaging.” Hi
 s new compositions draw\ninspiration from beyond the world of music\, inclu
 ding such artists as\nRichard Serra\, Mark Rothko and Robert Rauschenberg. 
  At the Laughing Goat\, he\nhopes to push the group towards using their div
 erse backgrounds to\nrealize concrete and universal themes within the music
 .  It should be\na night of surprises.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=bIKfsqJAq

 struggled with this for a while. I found mainstream pop to be too cliché\, 
 but most of the junk they taught me in school to be too foreign to the majo
 rity of listeners\, including myself. I've learned to calm this tension by 
 keeping pop forms and melodies\, while at the same time using jazz harmonie

 r banjo\, mandolin\, and lap slide guitar for starters). If not humbled\, w
 e are curious\; how did the former New Mexico resident attain this kind of 
 musical maturity at twenty-four? His biography explains somewhat: Amongst r
 ed rocks\, dry soil\, and clear sky\, Cahalen Morrison was reared on Hot Ri
 ze\, Doc Watson\, Norman Blake and Rory Block while running around in a dia
 per\, trying (at times unsuccessfully) not to fall into patches of prickly 
 pear. Now\, he’s got the ears for roots music. Hopping effortlessly from fi
 ngerpicking to mandolin\, clawhammer banjo to lap slide guitar\, Cahalen’s 
 writing encompasses everything from punchy political commentaries\, to soul
  warming serenades\, branching out into instrumental rags and fiddle tunes\
 , yet still retaining his subtle musical signature. Joining Cahalen will be
  flatpicker\, octave mandolin & clawhammer banjo player extraordinaire\, El
 i West\, of Seattle.\n\nwww.cahalen.com

DESCRIPTION:The Ericksons:\n\nThe Ericksons are sisters Bethany Erickson an
 d Jennifer Kochsiek. Their compelling style of indie-folk music is rich wit
 h sounds from acoustic guitars\, banjo\, string bass\, and stunning vocal h
 armonies. Growing up in the Midwest both sisters developed a deep relations
 hip with music at a young age. But The Ericksons really took shape in 2006 
 when the sisters began performing at venues in and around New York City. Th
 ey played as often as they could\, and wrote more and more songs.  Those so
 ngs soon became The Ericksons' debut album Middle of the Night\, recorded i
 n a basement studio in Brooklyn. In order to capture the most honest expres
 sion of each song\, they recorded each one live.  This beautiful and haunti
 ng album exhibits The Ericksons' soulful vocal melodies and heart wrenching
  lyrics. They sing of love. Life and death. Darkness and light. When one is
  the moon the other is the sun.   Since the album's release in the fall of 
 2008 The Ericksons have been touring\, playing shows all over the country. 
 When they are not on the road\, The Ericksons are now calling Minneapolis\,
  Minnesota their home.\n\nwww.myspace.com/theericksonsmusic\n\n$7 cover for

DESCRIPTION:Not an Airplane:\n\nNot an Airplane tends to dodge the labels o
 f country and bluegrass as their take on traditional music is steeped with 
 songwriting that matured in the atmosphere of contemporary folk. The band t
 akes their lyrically strong\, modern songs and uses thick three part vocal 
 harmonies\, and other traditional influences and instrumentation to propel 
 them forward into a sound all their own. Nick Shattell formed not an Airpla
 ne in his hometown of Syracuse\, NY as a project to showcase his songwritin
 g. Originally a folk-oriented\, solo artist that played acoustic guitar\, S
 hattell cut his teeth playing open-mic nights in local bars and cafés. Afte
 r moving to Northern California\, Shattell struggled through multiple incar
 nations of not an Airplane before finding joy in the current line-up of the
  band. It was shortly after the release of the 2008 EP that Shattell began 
 discussions with Jared Neilson (vocals\, upright bass) about abandoning the
 ir alt-country roots and developing their sound in new ways. The addition o
 f multi-instrumentalist Daniel Edward Harris (vocals\, guitar\, banjo\, dob
 ro) and Chris Haupt (drums) gave not an Airplane a breathe of fresh new lif
 e as well as a creative balance. “I have never felt more at home or more ex
 cited about the music we are making” Shattell recently said. Not an Airplan
 e will release “Things and People” in the early Spring of 2010. The album w
 as recorded over the course of six months with Luckey Lew in Modesto\, CA (
 Wave Parade Studios). The nine song full-length accurately captures the ban
 d’s live sound with little embellishment. Shattell’s lyrics shine through a
 nd are perfectly accented by the melodic styling’s of Harris. Neilson succe
 ssfully manages to tie those melodies together with Haupt’s smooth\, creati
 ve\, and tasteful rhythms. All of this layered with thick vocal harmonies\,
  and this foursome has launched itself outside of genres\, but will leave y
 ou singing and dancing along. \n\nnotanairplane.com

 nshine had been around for about five years.  Trevor Robbins (vocals\, guit
 ar\, and mandolin) and Aric Wilcox (guitar\, banjo\, and vocals) met while 
 playing in a rather goofy metal band called Icarus\, but soon realized they
  were far more interested in playing acoustic music. A mixture of americana
 \, pop\, and folk rock with a bit of bluegrass on the side\, Kaiser has bee
 n compared to the likes of Sufjan Stevens\, Okkervil River\, and Devendra B
 anhart. Their fresh and interesting sound will soothe the ears of all who l
 isten. The band has gigged around the Denver and Boulder areas since its bi
 rth\, playing with bands such as the Woodbox Gang\, Shakedown Street\, Tran
 sistor Radio Sound\, and Pictureplane\, while presently preparing for a gig
  with Akron/Family. Currently unsigned\, they have self-released two full a
 lbums of original music. The duo’s music has also been featured in an offic
 ial Dungeons & Dragons™ documentary\, and is included in many GroovyFilms® 
 productions. At a Kaiser Sunshine show\, one should expect a friendly atmos
 phere and a close connection to the band. Their stage presence gives off su
 ch a comfortable vibe that it is obvious these guys have been doing this fo
 r a while. In short\, it’s a blast\; they make the audience feel like close
  friends. Then they start playing\, and it becomes clear that they are seri
 ous and talented musicians.\n\nwww.myspace.com/kaisersunshine

  could match her heart are rare. One teary winter afternoon\, after finding
  herself heartbroken\, she drove to the music store and bought a ukulele. N
 ever would she have guessed that one truly can buy happiness. Every strum l
 ifted her soul\, and every blister on her thumb was a reminder of the glori
 ous strength in her smile. At the appearance of this discovery\, she decide
 d to commit herself to singing lovely little songs of joy\, and truth\,  wi
 th a pinch of beautiful sadness\, to sooth the hearts of other rosy cheeked
 \, lion hearted people. That they too may find such a love. The End. After 
 a life time of musical training on various instruments\, Harper Phillips st
 arted playing the ukulele in the fall of 2008.\, and having finally found h
 er musical soulmate\, began writing songs. After recieving a BA in Theatre 
 from the University of Colorado\, she decided to create an outlet for her h
 eart\, rather than waiting for one to find her. She is thrilled to share he
 r music with audiences in her home of Boulder\, Colorado.\n\nwww.harperphil

DESCRIPTION:''So\, You're a Poet\,'' presents an open poetry reading featur
 ing Amiri Baraka\, Anne Waldman\, Akilah Oliver\, & Ambrose Bye. Baraka was
  poet laurete of New Jersey. Waldman founded the writing program at Naropa 
 University. Every year they pack the house! $5 cover\n\nThe ''So\, You're a
  Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' has several Kerouac 
 events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in this venerable\,
  decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Bernadette Mayer (who
  will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program)\, Diane di 
 Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more. The series has al
 ways been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters\, owner of t
 he Pearl Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe series was hosted for 
 many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction to Poems from
  Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legendary Cabaret Volta
 ire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the cafes and bars i
 n San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\, also the cafe Me
 tro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East Village.''\nThe s
 eries currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse\, which ha
 s strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Miguel Algarin\, L
 ewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last year's Summer Writin
 g Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary institution in th
 e making.

DESCRIPTION:The Beaten Sea:\n\n"The Beaten Sea's songs certainly conjure te
 stier times\, but\, as a whole\, they make for a joyous collection. And\, i
 n turn\, this new outfit has not only offered up the finest area debut of t
 he year\, but also a contender for the finest album we've heard in 2010\, p
 eriod."  -The Dallas Observer \nThe majority of Beaten Sea's growing audien
 ce first made their acquaintance in any one of a now countless number of st
 ripped-down house shows\, scrunched up in narrow living rooms\, their atten
 tive brows hovering near the band's knees\, microphones thrown to the curb 
 long ago. In a city worn to boredom from the alternative glut of the mid '9
 0s\, it is fitting that musical authenticity in Dallas would find purpose a
 gain roaming from house to house like a hobbled ghost. The Beaten Sea know 
 that they're privileged to be part of this new undertaking\, lugging that o
 ld spirit around in a banjo case in a city over which looms the forgotten s
 pecters of Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson.\nTheir hauntingly appe
 aling sound would convince the most rational skeptic that ghosts and spirit
 s are surely wandering among us. They believe in the ghosts of dead loves\,
  prophetic crickets\, and humming sirens\, the characters in their songs ti
 ptoe through a shaky world held together by a grace that most often touches
  us with the business end of an axe. The Beaten Sea know that skin is for t
 ouching\, trees are for chopping down\, fingers for chopping off\, man made
  for toil\, fists made for beating away nightmares. It all happens within t
 he sounds and words of the ordinary\, made alive with the supernatural\, li
 ke a chorus of mystic clodhoppers.  \nThe writer Harry Crews once posited t
 hat the simplest Southern conversation is theological. Dallas is not the So
 uth and none of the members of The Beaten Sea are from Georgia\, but their 
 music wears the same habit. Whether they are reciting Apocalypse or channel
 ing Dostoevsky's dialogue with the Devil\, The Beaten Sea's songs sweat wit
 h God-talk\, wrapped in the timeworn melodies of American music at its pure
 st.\n\nwww.myspace.com/thebeatensea

DESCRIPTION:''So\, You're a Poet\,'' presents an open poetry reading featur
 ing Jack Hirschman & Jack Collom: The two combined have been writing poetry
  for 100 years and 125 books. Collom's been a belover Boulder poet for 6 de
 cades and Hershman was poet laurete of San Francisco.\n\nThe ''So\, You're 
 a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' has several Kerouac
  events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in this venerable\
 , decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Bernadette Mayer (wh
 o will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program)\, Diane di
  Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more. The series has a
 lways been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters\, owner of 
 the Pearl Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe series was hosted for
  many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction to Poems fro
 m Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legendary Cabaret Volt
 aire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the cafes and bars 
 in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\, also the cafe M
 etro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East Village.''\nThe 
 series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse\, which h
 as strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Miguel Algarin\, 
 Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last year's Summer Writi
 ng Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary institution in t
 he making.

DESCRIPTION:Pineross:\n\nPineross is the musical embodiment of songwriter a
 nd multi-instrumentalist Kevin Larkin.  Kevin began playing flatpick style 
 guitar when he moved to Boulder\, CO in 2000.  Soon after discovering a loc
 al Irish session on Sunday nights\, he bought a mandolin and started learni
 ng a stockpile of fiddle tunes\, mastering the mandolin in the following ye
 ars at the pub.  Pineross' debut album was released in 2006\, featuring man
 y of Boulder's finest musicians.  It is a medititation on the dying America
 n West\, a fusion of Spaghetti westerns\, bluegrass\, Irish melodies\, and 
 classic country.  \n"Larkin re-casts an American past\; he does so fluently
 \, with eyes as encompassing as Walt Whitman’s" -Tim Avery\, Independent Cl
 auses\n\nAlways restless and in need of seeing his native United States\, K
 evin moved to Oxford\, Mississippi in February of 2006 to join the Mayhem S
 tring Band on mandolin\, accordion and harmonica.  In the past 4 years this
  "outlaw" bluegrass band has toured constantly\, released 2 critically accl
 aimed albums\, and open shows for acts such as The Avett Brothers\, Del McC
 oury Band and B.B. King.  Their latest record\, Land Pirates (2009) was pro
 duced by Jimbo Mathus (Squirrel Nut Zippers).  Before a live performance in
  Oxford\, SPIN magazine described the Mayhem show as "The best time you'll 
 have all month."  \n\nKevin is currently recording with Pineross and a cros
 s country tour is being planned for the spring of 2010.  In a progression f
 rom his earlier work\, Larkin has gone on to incorporate Latin rhythms and 
 hip-hop lyricism into his music\, although his live show still seems as if 
 played on some Mississippi porch:  guitars\, mandolins\, tambourines\, kazo
 os\, and even a suitcase.  \n"He might have started with Bluegrass\; the en
 d result thought is something much more contemporary" - David \n\nwww.piner

DESCRIPTION:Leaving Countries:\n\nPelot and his fans describe it as a blend
  of folk\, rock\, bluegrass and blues reminiscent of Bob Dylan.\nIn fact\, 
 Dylan’s influence on Pelot seems almost destiny-like. Similar to Dylan\, Pe
 lot wanted to find the country influence of music embedded in the south\, s
 o when he moved to Georgia\, he settled on a farm on Highway 51 in Homer an
 d refers to it as Highway 51\, Revisited. Pelot’s music contains political\
 , social and spiritual storytelling separated from a particular ideology. D
 rawing from history and his own emotions\, Pelot said his music has a certa
 in harmony with universal viewpoints. “I believe in taking positive ideas\,
  religious or non-religious\, and bringing them together. A lot of what I w
 rite is about following your heart\,” he said. “Leaving Countries is a form
  of expressing the current moment and where you’re going. It’s a personal j
 ourney through the past\, present\, and future.” Pelot also encourages list
 eners to look at the larger picture and to respect each other’s religious a
 nd political views. Peace and the anti-war movement are some recurrent them
 es that have a personal connection to Pelot. His son\, Bishop\, reminds him
  of his grandfather\, who served 32 months in a German POW camp during Worl
 d War II. “War has had a great impact on us. It’s never far behind us. We’r
 e so occupied with things in our life that it’s easy to forget these histor
 ical events\,” Pelot said. “During life\, people make decisions that are no
 t rational. Going to war is one of those\, and you have to accept decisions
  others make and do what’s best. Leaving Countries is about earning up to r
 esponsibilities to spread peace and respect.”\n \n“Singing gives you an ide
 a of who you are. [Music] is my religion and my politics\,” he said. “Telli
 ng different truths require an outlet to express emotions. It’s important t
 o communicate. When people stop expressing themselves\, we become lost. For
  me\, pen and paper does this. I put my heart and soul into my music and th
 at’s what I live by.”  \n\nwww.myspace.com/leavingcountriesonthejourney

DESCRIPTION:Paul Cataldo:\n\nSee the man on the stage with the guitar. The 
 one with the perpetual five days scruff on his face and the not so clean fl
 annel shirt. The one with the Martin guitar who’s belting out a song about 
 mountains or rivers or roads. See the sardonic look on his face? It’s not f
 or long\, he’s just into his song. As soon as he’s finished singing you’ll 
 see a smile bloom on his face when he realizes that he’s one of the few peo
 ple who’ve found what they’re made for and is doing it for a living. He pla
 ys music.  \n\nHe’s been playing since\, at age fourteen\, he heard Neil Yo
 ung for the first time. He found his adolescent sanctuary in the form of a 
 guitar. He poured all his efforts into mastering the instrument with the so
 ngs of John Fogerty\, Lindsay Buckingham and David Gilmour to guide him. Sp
 ending hours\, days on end in his room\, bent over\, back aching completely
  focused on drawing all those classic rock songs from his Strat\, he got go
 od. He got really good and found himself playing lead with Shortbus\, a Bos
 ton base cover band. Three years of playing other peoples music was enough 
 and he moved to New York and scrounged up enough money to stay alive and bu
 y the Martin. Just in time for him to find the voice that was growing stron
 ger within him. A voice that was destined to flow from him outward on a wav
 e of strum and pick that told the stories of his life\, his heart and soul.
   His journey has just begun. Where his voice or his stories or his guitar 
 might lead him is anybody’s guess. It doesn’t really matter to him. He know
 s that it is in the journey where he will find his true voice again and aga
 in. It is in his successes and his failures that he will find the character
  to keep perusing his dreams. It is in his loves and his heartbreaks that h
 e will find the emotions that will have nowhere to go except out through hi
 s music.  \n\nPaul can be heard singing songs and telling stories about eve
 rything from alcoholism\, war\, poverty and jealousy all the way down the r
 oad to songs of peace and love.  You can usually find him on tour somewhere
  between Portland\, ME and Savannah\, GA.  His first full length LP "Rivers
 \, Roads & Mountains" (2009) has been receiving steady airplay on college s
 tations in the North East.  The LP was recorded at Quad Studios in Nashvill
 e\, the same room Young recorded his breakthrough record "Harvest".  Some o
 f Nashville's best known session players appear throughout the album as wel
 l as long time music companions Tony Montalbano and Eben Pariser of Rooseve
 lt Dime.   \n\nHis name is Paul Cataldo. He’s 27 and he's located in the Mo
 untains of Western North Carolina. He plays music.      \n\nwww.paulcataldo

DESCRIPTION:Eric "from Philly" Levy:\n\nStudying under John Kay from Bill H
 ailey and the Comets and other influential teachers along with a Bachelor o
 f Arts and Sciences in Music and Marketing from Drexel University\, Eric Le
 vy emerged from the local music scene in performances throughout  Philadelp
 hia and the Tri State area as “Eric from Philly.” Eric began playing guitar
  at age 11. Beginning with his first high school rock band\, Vital Signs\, 
 Eric has played lead guitar with many groups over the years including: Medi
 cine Men\, Resin\, Juliet’s Wishing Well\, Dr. Harmonica and Rockett 88. Er
 ic's sound can be heard on all of these bands' recordings\, including the r
 adio-friendly\, favorite local album\, Juliet's Wishing Well's\, Far from W
 inter. 'The Well\,' as the band was known by its fans\, performed regularly
  at many venues including The Lions Den and CBGB’s in New York City\, The T
 rocadero in Philadelphia and the Bottle & Cork in Dewey Beach. 'The Well' a
 lso opened for the Black Crowes at The Big Kahuna in Wilmington\, DE. \nSou
 ght out for his ability to bring an eclectic\, moody edge to an existing so
 und\, Eric has done studio work for many local artists over the years. His 
 musical styling can be found on the CDs of various local singer/songwriters
  such as John Torres' album\, From the Curbside of a Small Town\, Peace wit
 h Doubt’s All Lit Up\, and also on the compilation CD\, Homeslyce Soldiers\
 , to benefit the homeless by Aydin Say. \n “Eric from Philly” released his 
 debut album\, All Over the Place in February of 2010. From the plugged-in s
 ounds of hard and alternative rock to the unplugged classics of rhythm and 
 blues and slide guitar\, Eric's playing style crosses genres on purpose. \n
 The album knits layers together Eric’s personal expression and lyrics with 
 nimble-fingered chord progressions and road-seasoned slide guitar collided 
 with intricate violin\, cello and mandolin embellishments that evokes spine
  tingling results. With standout tracks like "Gone again\,"  “One of a Kind
 \,” “Perry County\,” and “Monterey\,” the music of “Eric from Philly” revea
 ls a most exhilarating album.  Music by “Eric from Philly” can be downloade

DESCRIPTION:Brian Bixler:\n\nb.bixler is a folk/rock act based in Boulder\,
  CO.  The band is essentially singer/songwriter b.bixler with an alternatin
 g cast of support players.  b.bixler's new CD\, "blemished\," represents hi
 s wide range of songwriting\, from quirky compositions like "merry-go-round
 \," written from the perspective of Lewis Carroll who's confessing his love
  to the inspiring child\, Alice Liddle\, to the beautiful melodies of "jesi
 's song" about falling out of love\, or even neo-rock-a-billy songs about t
 he human condition like "a way through this." Influenced at first by folk m
 usic and rock 'n' roll\, b.bixler turned to classical playing when he was 1
 9. While taking a major in creative writing\, b.bixler also gained classica
 l vocal training as a tenor and earned a minor in classical guitar performa
 nce. As an ensemble member of the NCSU Concert Choir\, b.bixler performed V
 erdi's Requiem with Raleigh Oratoria Society and the North Carolina Symphon
 y and joined the ensemble throughout Italy on a short performance tour. He 
 has given guitar recitals in Raleigh and Charlotte as well as working with 
 choirs as a guitar accompanist. After college\, he continued studying guita
 r and writing songs\, traveling and playing well received shows across the 
 country. His songs can best be described as the culmination of years of var
 ious\, concentrated musical studies. Though he now plays a nylon string gui
 tar almost exclusively\, b.bixler has not set aside his lyricism. While his
  lyrics tend toward storytelling\, recalling folksy roots and fiction works
 hops\, his music often strays from the typical I-IV-V-I chord progression t
 o something more tonally complex.\n\nwww.myspace.com/brianbixlermusic

 sistor Radio Sound\, and Pictureplane\, while presently preparing for a gig
  with Akron/Family. Currently unsigned\, they have self-released two full a

 productions. At a Kaiser Sunshine show\, one should expect a friendly atmos
 phere and a close connection to the band. Their stage presence gives off su

DESCRIPTION:CK Rust:\n\nFueled by a distaste of mundane local music and the
  debased creativity of mainstream music\, CK Rust draws its inspiration fro
 m the bombastic grooves of 60’s garage rock and fuses it with the explosive
  nature of 70’s and 80’s punk. Combine this with a passion for hypnotic mel
 ody and keen rhythmic sensibility and you have a group with a style all its
  own. CK Rust\, like any inspiring act\, started in the basement. The nucle
 us of brothers Will and Vince Russo would provide the group’s core sound. A
 fter growing up listening to classic and alternative rock these dudes just 
 wanted to continue the tradition of energetic\, interesting music. Unable t
 o find any other musicians\, the duo decided to keep it simple. Will provid
 es the constant drum beats while Vince churns out the sonic goods on guitar
 . After literally years of playing together in their parent’s basement the 
 group is ready to take their act to the streets and unleash their sound on 
 whom ever cares to listen. CK Rust. Less truly is more. \n\nwww.myspace.com

 e.com/robbrocks\n\nJaden:\n\nHi\, my name is Jaden. I live in Colorado and 
 I play acoustic and electric guitar. I love playing guitar\, especially in 
 front of crowds and jamming with my musician friends. I started playing aft
 er my mom took me to a Michael Franti and Spearhead concert a few years ago
 . While I was watching the lead guitarist and bass player rip it up\, I dec
 ided that playing guitar was going to be mine too. I started lessons with a
  great teacher\, who began me on an acoustic guitar\, learning classical mu
 sic. It wasn't long before I was learning some pretty cool rock songs and f
 iguring out many covers to play. I write my own original music as well\, an
 d it was after my very good friend Versace encouraged me to start singing t
 hat I became a singer/songwriter as well as a guitarist. I now have a cd ti
 tled "Midnight Sky" that was recorded and produced by Versace in San Franci
 sco. My favorite thing to do is jam on my Fender Stratocaster\, with the am
 p turned way up! I have played a lot of shows already\; coffee houses\, bal
 lrooms\, private parties\, clubs and festivals. I have had the great opport
 unity to play with Michael Franti and Spearhead\, Trevor Hall\, Chris Steel
 e\, Mario Pagliarula\, Keaton Simons\, Radioactive\, Melvin Seals and The J
 GB\, and Matt Butler. Through my music\, I have met the most amazing people
  who have inspired and motivated me\, as well as supported me on my journey
 . They have become both mentors and friends and I hope to continue along th
 is path\, as far as I can take it. Thank you for reading this\, and I hope 
 to see you at my gigs! Peace\, Jaden\n\nwww.myspace.com/jadencarlson

DESCRIPTION:"So\, You're a Poet\," presents an open poetry night:\n\nThe ''
 So\, You're a Poet'' reading series by Boulder's ''beat book shop'' has sev
 eral Kerouac events on its poetry calendar. Poets who have performed in thi
 s venerable\, decades-old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Bernadet
 te Mayer (who will be in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program
 )\, Diane di Prima\, Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more. The 
 series has always been hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters
 \, owner of the Pearl Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe series wa
 s hosted for many years by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction 
 to Poems from Penny Lane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legendary 
 Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the caf
 es and bars in San Francisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\, als
 o the cafe Metro and the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East Vill
 age.''\nThe series currently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehou
 se\, which has strong ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Migue
 l Algarin\, Lewis MacAdams\, and other poets read there during last year's 
 Summer Writing Program. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary inst
 itution in the making.

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson:\n\nJeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans
  native\, has spent the last fifteen years living everywhere but his hometo
 wn. As songwriter and performer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine 
 through but his songs are steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. F
 rom his years playing the songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three 
 year stint as a graduate student in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his curre
 nt home in the mountains of Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs ru
 n almost as wide a gamut as his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as
  the performer's background. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\,
  Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\, Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consiste
 nt thread that runs throughout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and
  distinctively his own. In the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Att
 ic biannual "shoot out" in Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to c
 ommit full-time to the "performing songwriter" craft. After spending three 
 years touring\, he took a five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "da
 ylights" as a psychotherapist. Although he has no intention of quitting his
  day job any time soon (he likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided 
 to get back out there! "Thompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy
  breathiness\, a bit of a good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothin
 g quality that is all his own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, 
 proving himself capable of leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control 
 over his vocal power. But a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't
  mean what you sing. And luckily\, Thompson means every note." \n\nwww.jeff

DESCRIPTION:WadiRum:\n\nWadiRum was named by the band's leader\, Stewart Er
 lich\, after traveling for 6 months in the middle east. Wadi Rum is a regio
 n in Jordan where Erlich found himself miraculously healed after suffering 
 a debilitating illness during his travels in the desert. \n\nThe music is m
 uch like the region: raw\, powerful\, silent and loud in turns\, and ultima
 tely healing. \n\nWadiRum's songs build to crescendo\, with lush harmony\, 
 dark\, warm bass and cello\, and drums that move from subtle to explosive. 
 Each song is different\, but the message is the same- the revelation of the
  human heart. \n\nAs a band\, we try to make great music onstage and in the
  studio... we write our songs together\, and bring our diverse backgrounds 
 into the musical melting pot. Our strengths include using full-range dynami
 cs\, and creating songs with evocative lyrics. \n\nWe perform in and around
  Denver and Boulder regularly\, and tend to prefer good 'listening' venues.
  \n\nCurrently\, we've started working on creating songs for our third albu
 m\, and are searching for a vocalist to replace our dear friend Jill who ha
 s moved out east...\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/wadirum\n

DESCRIPTION:Chris Mc Garry:\n\nBorn on the Mississippi River and raised on 
 Methodist hymns\, folk ballads and vintage country\, learning to play was a
  necessity for Chris McGarry. After simultaneously picking up a guitar and 
 an obsession with Walt Whitman\, creating his own songs became inevitable. 
 Residing in Denver’s Capitol Hill\, McGarry is part of the new breed of old

 for inspiration found in the form of depression-era 78’s transferred to mp3
  format. Yet\, despite his relocation to an urban environment\, his immersi
 on into modern amenities and a post-beatnik lyrical style\, McGarry’s music
 al roots remain sedentary\; melodies as haunted as the river bluffs and a v
 oice as gravelly as the silt laden shores he wandered as a child.\n\nChris 
 will play Friday\, February 5th at 7:30pm at the Laughing Goat Café in Boul
 der as an opener for Mojomama.  This show is one of several McGarry will be
  using to promote the release of his debut record\, ‘and the weary eyes rep

DESCRIPTION:Shannon Curtis:\n\nWhen Shannon Curtis was 5\, she danced and s
 ang along to her dad playing 40’s-era standards on her family’s baby grand.
  When she was 7\, her classical piano teacher told her she played like a bo
 y. When she was 9\, she sang into her hairbrush pretending to be Amy Grant.
  Just out of college\, she shirked her pre-med Biology degree and made an e
 arnest effort as the lead singer in a guitar-based rock band. Three years a
 go she found her piano again\, started writing love songs\, and quit the ba
 nd. Since then she says it’s been like walking around in an old\, comfortab
 le pair of shoes – playing the piano and singing songs about love. The Los 
 Angeles Times describes Shannon as "... a beautiful piano player who sounds
  like the love child of Fiona Apple and Norah Jones." Shannon's debut EP\, 
 Boomerangs & Seesaws\, was released in July 2007 on the tiny Saint Cloud Re
 cords label\, and the follow up\, Paris Can't Have You\, was released in Ma
 rch 2008. Constant touring and placements in TV and film have been building
  Shannon a devoted following across the country.\n\nwww.myspace.com/shannon

DESCRIPTION:Spencer Pendleton:\n\n"I am a singer/songwriter who was raised 
 in the town of Sevierville\, TN\, which lies in the shadows of both the Gre
 at Smoky Mountains and Dolly Parton. Dolly was everywhere. In street names\
 , on billboards\, and especially in the DNA of my classmates. Dolly Parton 
 made millions singing about her simple mountain upbringing\, but the simple
  place that she sang about isn't so simple any more. The valleys are filled
  with the kitschy trappings of a Southern tourist economy and the mountains
  are being covered in ridge-top rental developments faster than a banjo sou
 nds\, all of which is due largely to her Appalachian-themed amusement park\
 , Dollywood\, which attracts midwesterners like moths to a bug zapper. Some
  have expected from me (and at times I have expected from myself) a certain
  degree of traditional authenticity in my music\, and I suppose growing up 
 around the tones and forms of bluegrass and string music has\, in some ines
 capable way\, influenced the way I write and perform. However\, it is the i
 rony of a region robbed of its dignity and forced to reduce its traditions 
 to song and dance shows and an overall disenchantment with small-town life\
 , love\, and politics from which I derive my biggest inspiration for writin
 g. Other than that\, I like to think that me and Ms. Parton might have a lo
 t in common...maybe even a little DNA."\n\nwww.myspace.com/spencerpelton.

DESCRIPTION:Erik Deutsch:\n\nFormer Boulder resident Erik Deutsch is as bus
 y as anyone in the music business.  Currently a resident of Brooklyn\, NY\,
  the pianist has recently worked with Norah Jones\, Trevor Dunn\, and Eller
 y Eskelin (to name a few).   He just wrapped up three years in the Charlie 
 Hunter Trio (recording Mistico and Baboon Strength)\, and is currently spli
 tting time with Kristina Train and Erin McKeown in support of their new alb
 ums. Erik has recently completed work on a new album: Hush Money.  Released
  the past November\, the music reflects a unique balance between the chambe
 r-esque cinematic composition of Deutsch’s previous record\, Fingerprint\, 
 with the rhythm and blues esthetic of Charlie Hunter.  Throw in a heavy dos
 e of Erik’s extensive arsenal of analog synthesizers and Hush Money is sure
 ly the most wide-ranging recording of his career. Joining him at the Laughi
 ng Goat is bassist Greg Garrison (Punch Brothers\, Leftover Salmon) and dru
 mmer Colin Stranahan (NYC). “Erik Deutsch\, a pianist with a taste for tune
 ful provocation\, is an especially valuable resource as a solo commentator 
 and accompanist…” – NY Times\n\nwww.hammerandstring.com

DESCRIPTION:Ben Hanna:\n\n"I had a skateboard\, a Playstation (with a mod c
 hip\, if you're cool enough to know what that is)\, and a guitar. All the t
 oys a suburban only child would hope for\, and likely receive growing up in
  the upper middle class suburbs of Detroit during the Clinton years (MTV wa
 s even cool). I was a wanna be watered down punk rocker in 1999\, an indie 
 rocker in 2000\, an emo kid in 2001\, and a wanna be watered down metal hea
 d in 2002. I tried pot in 2003 and started listening to Bob Dylan\, Jimi He
 ndrix\, The Beatles\, and other classics I had missed out on during the ons
 et of puberty. At this point\, my best friends father\, an avid record coll
 ector who lived two doors down from me gave me an album\; "Townes Van Zandt
 - Live at the Old Quarter". It sat in my cd book full of burned cds for mon
 ths\, next to The Getup Kids\, NOFX\, Screeching Weasel\, and other choice 
 discs that helped me find it. Finally\, I got bored on an airplane and popp
 ed it in my Disc Man (remember those?) circa 2003 on a flight from Detroit 
 to Colorado\, where I was soon to live. In this disc\, which I had heard ma
 ny times before\, I heard something different. It was extraordinarily ordin
 ary\; a man\, just one man who transcended the "singer/ songwriter" genre t
 o earnestly tell the story of his life experience through the template of a
  song. As Lou Reed put it\, (to paraphrase) "I'm an artist\, the music is j
 ust one aspect of what I do". Granted\, Townes' sound was very characterist
 ic of his time and location\, but there was something completely abstract a
 nd brilliant in his music I had never heard before... A certain "sentiment"
  I suppose. I realized the artist defines the genre\, not the other way aro
 und. Not being skilled enough to learn any cover song and actually do it ju
 stice\, I set out on a quest to find a compromise that included my love of 
 music\, my desire to play it\, and my basic guitar skills. Thus\, I wrote m
 y first song. Its been a journey ever since. .."\n\nwww.myspace.com/benjami

DESCRIPTION:Nick and the Jungle Band:\n\nNicholas Jerrems is a Southern Cal
 ifornia native who over indulges in “old” music ranging from early American
 a roots\, to 1950’s rockabilly. This leads to the belief from everyone arou
 nd him\, that is birth was a matter of displacement\, and he was meant for 
 a different time period. This being said\, he set off to make music that co
 mbined his old influences from the likes of Artie Shaw\, Buddy Holly\, Todd
  Rollins\, And Elvis\, and mold it into a semi new fresh sound\, without be
 ing a slight variation of a cover band. The product is the aberrant\, Nick 
 and the Jungle Band. Nick has played in numerous acts\, including the succe
 ssful Cicada who released two full length CD’s\, did a nation wide tour\, a
 nd played to over 2000 people at the Los Angeles Convention Center. When Ni
 ck decided to take on the jungle band\, he called up long time friend and r
 ecent band mate\, Jacob Nee. Jacob Nee is also a SoCal native\, coming from
  a formal and well taught musical background. Jacob has played drums in suc
 h acts as Cicada\, as well as recording in Disney’s music studio in Los Ang
 eles. He has played numerous shows including a date at the Wiltern in LA. J
 acob is also very talented at hand percussion\, in which he took a liking t
 o his wooden box like drum\, the cajon. Starting in early 2009\, Nick and J
 acob went to one of their long time friend’s recording studios\, to start t
 racking some songs. The first cut for the album to be finished was “Painter
 s”\, which was completed in the summer of 2009. Over the past year they hav
 e been diligently working at finishing the record in which they will promot
 e this May/June on their nation wide tour. The CD simply titled\, “Nick and
  the Jungle Band”\, is strange at times\, but hopes to promote an honest an
 d relatable sound\, while keeping the songs fresh as you progress through t
 he album. Long time friend Jon Ruiz\, a gifted and talented guitar player w
 ho’s credits include Waiting for Wyatt\, will be accompanying the band this
  spring on tour. \n\nwww.nickandthejungleband.com

 a skill she acquired in the mountains and has brought\, since the fall of 2
 008\, to the city of Austin\, TX.  From the first note to the last\, you'll
  never hear a moment of hesitation in her songwriting nor in her voice.  An
  admirer of Bonnie Raitt\, Susan Tedeschi and Patty Griffin\, Margo is ofte

 aised in a musical family\, learning multiple instruments and harmonizing b
 efore she even knew what she was absorbing from the Townes Van Zandt and Bo

 guitar naturally followed suit\, allowing her the freedom to be a self-suff

 her first release since 2008.  The new EP was recorded with famed Austin gu
 itarist Rich Brotherton (Robert Earl Keen) \, keyboardist Riley Osbourn and
  her Austin-based band in just a few days at Brotherton's South Austin stud
 io\, Ace Recording.  Margo gives her audience a sense of her new approach t
 o songwriting and a taste of her ever-evolving vocal sound.  I Can't Pray f

DESCRIPTION:WadiRum:\n\nWadiRum was named by the band's leader\, Stewart Er
 lich\, after traveling for 6 months in the middle east. Wadi Rum is a regio
 n in Jordan where Erlich found himself miraculously healed after suffering 
 a debilitating illness during his travels in the desert. \n\nThe music is m
 uch like the region: raw\, powerful\, silent and loud in turns\, and ultima
 tely healing. \n\nWadiRum's songs build to crescendo\, with lush harmony\, 
 dark\, warm bass and cello\, and drums that move from subtle to explosive. 
 Each song is different\, but the message is the same- the revelation of the
  human heart. \n\nAs a band\, we try to make great music onstage and in the
  studio... we write our songs together\, and bring our diverse backgrounds 
 into the musical melting pot. Our strengths include using full-range dynami
 cs\, and creating songs with evocative lyrics. \n\nWe perform in and around
  Denver and Boulder regularly\, and tend to prefer good 'listening' venues.
  \n\nCurrently\, we've started working on creating songs for our third albu
 m\, and are searching for a vocalist to replace our dear friend Jill who ha
 s moved out east...\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/wadirum\n

DESCRIPTION:Oak Creek:\n\nWhile knowing each other for years from growing u
 p in the same small town of Sedona\, AZ\, it wasn’t until their senior year
  in high school when Daniel Watters and Jenna Cunningham discovered a music
 al talent together. Asked to sing something together for their high school 
 graduation\, the two decided on “Bridge Over Troubled Waters” by Simon and 
 Garfunkel\, and a musical connection was made. Throughout the past 4 years\
 , Daniel and Jenna have been songwriting in long-distance fashion\; Daniel 
 attending university in Los Angeles while Jenna way fared her way around th
 e world\, performing whenever and wherever their paths crossed. It wasn’t u
 ntil early 2009\, after Daniel graduated college\, that he decided to join 
 Jenna in Colorado where they can finally pursue their music together\, full
  time and face to face. Both Aquarians and avid lovers of The Beatles\, Dan
 iel and Jenna come together to create Oak Creek\, a harmonic\, folk-filled\
 , energy to be reckoned with. They have been compared to the Canadian indie
 -pop band\, Stars\, as well as the folk-rock band Rilo Kiley from Los Angel
 es. Both pull influences from bands such as Fleet Foxes\, Broken Social Sce
 ne\, Phoenix\, Wilco\, Stevie Wonder\, Simon and Garfunkel\, and of course\
 , The Beatles. While Daniel already has 2 solo albums under his belt\, with
  Jenna making an appearance or two on both\, they are only songs away from 
 recording their first album together as Oak Creek. Currently\, Oak Creek ar
 e living in and performing around Denver\, CO.\n\n\nwww.myspace.com/oakcree

 -old series include the late Allen Ginsberg\, Bernadette Mayer (who will be
  in Boulder this summer for the Summer Writing Program)\, Diane di Prima\, 
 Janine Pommy Vega\, Anselm Hollo\, and many more. The series has always bee
 n hosted by poet and Kerouac School alumnus Tom Peters\, owner of the Pearl
  Street landmark ''beat book shop.'' \n\nThe series was hosted for many yea
 rs by the famous Penny Lane Cafe. In the introduction to Poems from Penny L
 ane Anne Waldman writes ''One thinks of the legendary Cabaret Voltaire in Z
 urich where the Dadaist movement was born\, or the cafes and bars in San Fr
 ancisco which spawned the Beat Literary Movement\, also the cafe Metro and 
 the Nuyorican Cafe\, both in New York City's East Village.''\nThe series cu
 rrently takes place in the new Laughing Goat Coffeehouse\, which has strong
  ties to the original Penny Lane. Amiri Baraka\, Miguel Algarin\, Lewis Mac
 Adams\, and other poets read there during last year's Summer Writing Progra
 m. The Laughing Goat is surely a Boulder literary institution in the making

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson: \n\nA New Orleans native\, has spent the
  last fifteen years living everywhere but his hometown. As songwriter and p
 erformer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine through but his songs a
 re steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. From his years playing t
 he songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three year stint as a graduat
 e student in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his current home in the mountain
 s of Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs run almost as wide a gamu
 t as his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as the performer's backgr
 ound. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\, Nick Drake\, Ellis Pau
 l\, Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consistent thread that runs thr
 oughout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and distinctively his own.
  In the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Attic biannual "shoot out"
  in Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to commit full-time to the 
 "performing songwriter" craft. After spending three years touring\, he took
  a five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "daylights" as a psychothe
 rapist. Although he has no intention of quitting his day job any time soon 
 (he likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided to get back out there! 
 "Thompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy breathiness\, a bit of
  a good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothing quality that is all h
 is own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, proving himself capable
  of leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control over his vocal power. B
 ut a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't mean what you sing. An
 d luckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jefferyhyde.com\nwww.myspace.

DESCRIPTION:Michael DeLalla:\n\nIn a performing and recording career of mor
 e than two decades\, guitarist and composer Michael DeLalla has brought his
  delicious brew of traditional influences and classical\, jazz\, Celtic and
  folk stylings into the forefront of acoustic music. Beginning in the '80s 
 as the driving force behind Philo/Fretless recording artists Oxymora\, the 
 seminal group that Tom Cole of National Public Radio called "the cutting ed
 ge of New Acoustic Music"\, Michael has forged a distinguished and storied 
 career on stage and studio from his fluency on Classical\, 12-string\, and 
 steel-string acoustic guitar and memorable performances that showcase gifte
 d improvisation and dazzling technical facility that never sacrifices the r
 ichness and poignancy of his compositions. Michael performs as a solo artis
 t\, with the reunited Oxymora\, and as a member of the acclaimed traditiona
 l Celtic trio The Unfortunate Rakes. His solo concerts feature his original
  compositions and arrangements of traditional tunes that showcase his parti
 cular virtuosity\, punctuated by his wry\, sometimes irreverent observation
 s of the experiences that are behind the pieces. The result is not just a c
 ollection of instrumental works\, but also a narrative of his travels and t
 ravails found in his varied musical habitats\, from a capella singing in Br
 eton Gaelic to tweaking the nose of the Classical world with his raucous "P
 iece for Steel Drum (If I Played Steel Drum)".\n\nwww.FallingMountain.com\n

DESCRIPTION:Meryl Romer:\n\n"Meryl Romer embodies the current renaissance o
 f the romantic singers of the 40's.  Her sound recalls the voluptuous shape
  of Sarah Vaughan\, the ease and elegance of Ella Fitzgerald and a heart-sh
 uddering vibrato reminiscent of Judy Garland.  She sings with a tenderness 
 of heart blown through the essence of maturity.  When Meryl wraps her voice
  around the lyrical standards of jazz\, there is an innuendo of innocence t
 hat yields a most sophisticated lady." -  Vocalist/Producer\, Casey Collins

DESCRIPTION:Mark's Midnight Carnival Show:\n\nMark's Midnight Carnival Show
  is an Indie-Acoustic-Powerpop trio with a passion for performing live. Mar
 k Bush (Texas) - Vocals & Guitar\, Scott Bein (Missouri) - Guitar and Gavin
  Straub (Michigan) - Percussion make up this motley group of misfits. The b
 and attacks their music head on\, layering intensely powerful vocals\, smoo
 thly inventive guitar lines\, and rhythmic precision with a percussive acou
 stic sound creating something rare and unseen in modern music. Playing all 
 over Colorado and to places beyond they deliver the hard and the soft\, the
  electric and the unplugged\, the up and the down seamlessly. The band bega
 n as a solo act with Mark Bush back in December of 2007. For almost 2 years
  Mark performed around southern Colorado honing his skills as a performer a
 nd paving the way the band would follow. Mark began writing and performing 
 when he was 14. Now 33\, Mark feels he is best represented live. Whether it
  is the ultra-seductive Remember Me\, the make you wanna move Moon Song\, o
 r the fan favorite That Girl\, Mark knows how to pull his audience into his
  music. No song is long enough or can be played too often. And those are ju
 st the originals. With the odd cover thrown in here and there\, everyone is
  sure to find something in their performances to sing along with. Heard any
 where from the local bar\, to the coffee shops\, and the farmers market\, t
 here is no reason you should be staying home when Marks Midnight Carnival S
 how is playing. From Miles Davis to Phantom Planet\, from Dave Mathews to R
 adiohead\, and somewhere in between it all you get a bit of Cindi Lauper. T
 he Band fuses a sound that is unique\, but at the same time familiar and mo
 st of all memorable. With influences ranging from all genres and periods of
  music\, they move effortlessly from one to the other. The band is sure to 
 catch the attention of everyone who comes within earshot of their music. So
  set your TiVo to record tonight's episode of So You Think You Can Dance\, 
 tell the babysitter you wont be home early\, and get ready to RAWK! Marks M

 b Dylan\, Woody Guthrie\, Ryan Adams and the Beatles. It’s a familiar backd
 rop and melody that allows you the joy of recognition while leaving room fo
 r the thrill of surprise.\n \nThe lyrical influences are from the time and 
 space of drifting through the landscape and into the daily life of the city
 . Take the elegant simplicity of Steinbeck\, add the emotion of an idealist
 \, and you've got a unique combination that brings satisfaction on the firs

  instinctive touch for storytelling and the simple details of life that rev

 “Listening to one of Matty’s songs is like meeting a new friend\, but one t

 amiliarity that makes it easy to go new places. And at the end of it\, you 
 feel like you just had a really great conversation.”\n \nAfter living on ti

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson:\n\nJeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans
  native\, has spent the last fifteen years living everywhere but his hometo
 wn. As songwriter and performer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine 
 through but his songs are steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. F
 rom his years playing the songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three 
 year stint as a graduate student in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his curre
 nt home in the mountains of Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs ru
 n almost as wide a gamut as his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as
  the performer's background. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\,
  Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\, Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consiste
 nt thread that runs throughout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and
  distinctively his own. In the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Att
 ic biannual "shoot out" in Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to c
 ommit full-time to the "performing songwriter" craft. After spending three 
 years touring\, he took a five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "da
 ylights" as a psychotherapist. Although he has no intention of quitting his
  day job any time soon (he likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided 
 to get back out there! "Thompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy
  breathiness\, a bit of a good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothin
 g quality that is all his own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, 
 proving himself capable of leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control 
 over his vocal power. But a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't
  mean what you sing. And luckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jeffer

DESCRIPTION:Michael DeLalla:\n\nIn a performing and recording career of mor
 e than two decades\, guitarist and composer Michael DeLalla has brought his
  delicious brew of traditional influences and classical\, jazz\, Celtic and
  folk stylings into the forefront of acoustic music. Beginning in the '80s 
 as the driving force behind Philo/Fretless recording artists Oxymora\, the 
 seminal group that Tom Cole of National Public Radio called "the cutting ed
 ge of New Acoustic Music"\, Michael has forged a distinguished and storied 
 career on stage and studio from his fluency on Classical\, 12-string\, and 
 steel-string acoustic guitar and memorable performances that showcase gifte
 d improvisation and dazzling technical facility that never sacrifices the r
 ichness and poignancy of his compositions. Michael performs as a solo artis
 t\, with the reunited Oxymora\, and as a member of the acclaimed traditiona
 l Celtic trio The Unfortunate Rakes. His solo concerts feature his original
  compositions and arrangements of traditional tunes that showcase his parti
 cular virtuosity\, punctuated by his wry\, sometimes irreverent observation
 s of the experiences that are behind the pieces. The result is not just a c
 ollection of instrumental works\, but also a narrative of his travels and t
 ravails found in his varied musical habitats\, from a capella singing in Br
 eton Gaelic to tweaking the nose of the Classical world with his raucous "P
 iece for Steel Drum (If I Played Steel Drum)".\n\nwww.FallingMountain.com\n

DESCRIPTION:Ivory Drive:\n\nDistinctive Alternative Music\n\nWith high ener
 gy tunes and creative tempo changes\, Alternative Rock might best describe 
 Ivory Drive’s music\, but their sound isn’t easily pigeonholed. Ivory Drive
 ’s five musicians combine on piano\, organ\, drums\, bass\, trumpet\, and s
 ax to produce songs that are fresh and original with an audience pleasing v
 ariety. Unusually complex for "rock" music\, their songs are peppered with 
 generous amounts of jazz\, folk\, blues\, world\, and even classical.\n\nIv
 ory Drive’s full-length debut album\, "From This Far"\, propels its listene
 rs through high energy\, danceable tunes punctuated by moments of brooding 
 sentiment.  Recorded at Wave Stable Studios in Aurora\, CO\, and mastered a
 t Airshow Mastering in Boulder\, CO\, the 13 original tracks of "From This 
 Far" culminate two years of songwriting\, recording\, and production. \n\nI
 vory Drive has been warmly received at their live shows in the Denver and B
 oulder area. Venues they’ve played include: The Larimer Lounge\, The Hi-Div
 e\, The Oriental Theater\, and The University of Colorado campus.  The band
  has a tight live show\, with superb musicianship as can be seen in the vid
 eo included with this EPK.\n\nMost recently\, Ivory Drive has experienced r
 emarkable success on the web\, including two popular web sites where listen
 ers rate songs\, and the highest rated songs "rise on the charts".  On OurS
 tage.com\, four songs on the album "From This Far" out-paced hundreds of so
 ngs to place in the top 10.  Two of the four finished #1 in their respectiv
 e categories.  OurStage recently declared Ivory Drive to be one of the top 
 artists on their site. On thesixtyone.com\, a listener based site\, the ban
 d has quickly become a fan favorite\, gaining new fans all over the world. 
 The music listeners on these sites are looking for new and exciting music\,
  and they have made it clear that they love Ivory Drive.\n\nIvory Drive was
  started in Boulder\, Colorado in the fall of 2007 by Van Wampler on keyboa
 rds and vocals\, Wes Barton on drums\, Sean Whissen on bass\, Geoff Boux on
  saxophone\, and Colton Crandell on trumpet. The band’s creative group proc
 ess of arranging songs and showcasing the individual talents of each band m
 ember gives rise to the fresh sound that is Ivory Drive.\n\nThe reaction of
  fans confirms that this is a band to watch. Their music receives descripti
 ons such as "moving\," "lyrical\," "exceptional"\, and of course "unique." 
 Another thing out of the ordinary about Ivory Drive is their appeal to almo
 st everyone who hears them - all age groups enjoy Ivory Drive’s music.

DESCRIPTION:Signel-Z:\n\nThe Signel-Z group plays jazz\; interpretations of
   standards\, original compositions and provides a deep musical sound. The 
 group concept is to play heartfelt music avoiding preconceived commercial p
 rerogatives. As Sun Ra said\, “Space  is the place.” We love the space and 
 mysterious places in the music.\nThe core personnel of the group are Steven
  Ignelzi/guitar\, Kurt Ehrenman/woodwinds\, Bill Capsalis/Bass\, Stephen Th
 urston/keyboards\, Tate Ignelzi/Drums\, Gregg Wilkins/percussion. The group
  expands like the universe and contracts like an accordion to fit the occas
 ion and to operate within the spirit of jazz and the circumstances.\nThe mu
 sical presentation stresses good times and off color arrangements to create
  the steller atmosphere.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/signelz

DESCRIPTION:Dax Tran-Caffee:\n\n"As with his songs\, there is no showmanshi
 p\, legerdemain\, pretense or fanfare in the presentation of this non-tradi
 tional puppetry. On stage\, Dax has a deceptively casual manner - meanwhile
 \, glowing stars pop out of suitcases of their own accord\, and apparitions
  rise out of heaps of cardboard and collapse just as quickly. Nothing is hi
 dden in the straight-forward construction of the puppets and apparatuses\, 
 and yet each piece unfolds a moment of magic that is as moving as it was di
 rect. These shows cleverly present the fascination that has been lost to us
  since childhood\, though you wouldn't imagine how simply it was achieved."

 rms original songs on accordion and wine glasses in an american folk style\

 e. Each song is different\, but the message is the same- the revelation of 
 the human heart. \n\nAs a band\, we try to make great music onstage and in 
 the studio... we write our songs together\, and bring our diverse backgroun
 ds into the musical melting pot. Our strengths include using full-range dyn
 amics\, and creating songs with evocative lyrics. \n\nWe perform in and aro

DESCRIPTION:Pineross:\n\nPineross is the musical embodiment of songwriter a
 nd multi-instrumentalist Kevin Larkin.  Kevin began playing flatpick style 
 guitar when he moved to Boulder\, CO in 2000.  Soon after discovering a loc
 al Irish session on Sunday nights\, he bought a mandolin and started learni
 ng a stockpile of fiddle tunes\, mastering the mandolin in the following ye
 ars at the pub.  Pineross' debut album was released in 2006\, featuring man
 y of Boulder's finest musicians.  It is a medititation on the dying America
 n West\, a fusion of Spaghetti westerns\, bluegrass\, Irish melodies\, and 
 classic country.  \n"Larkin re-casts an American past\; he does so fluently
 \, with eyes as encompassing as Walt Whitman’s" -Tim Avery\, Independent Cl
 auses\n\nAlways restless and in need of seeing his native United States\, K
 evin moved to Oxford\, Mississippi in February of 2006 to join the Mayhem S
 tring Band on mandolin\, accordion and harmonica.  In the past 4 years this
  "outlaw" bluegrass band has toured constantly\, released 2 critically accl
 aimed albums\, and open shows for acts such as The Avett Brothers\, Del McC
 oury Band and B.B. King.  Their latest record\, Land Pirates (2009) was pro
 duced by Jimbo Mathus (Squirrel Nut Zippers).  Before a live performance in
  Oxford\, SPIN magazine described the Mayhem show as "The best time you'll 
 have all month."  \n\nKevin is currently recording with Pineross and a cros
 s country tour is being planned for the spring of 2010.  In a progression f
 rom his earlier work\, Larkin has gone on to incorporate Latin rhythms and 
 hip-hop lyricism into his music\, although his live show still seems as if 
 played on some Mississippi porch:  guitars\, mandolins\, tambourines\, kazo
 os\, and even a suitcase.  \n"He might have started with Bluegrass\; the en
 d result thought is something much more contemporary" - David \n\nwww.piner

  the guitar\, its me. I like to think i have a sound all my own although so
 me friends in the audience have mentioned that i sound like Jewel\, Emi Lou

 p in the same small town of Sedona\, AZ\, it wasn’t until their senior year
  in high school when Daniel Watters and Jenna Cunningham discovered a music
 al talent together. Asked to sing something together for their high school 
 graduation\, the two decided on “Bridge Over Troubled Waters” by Simon and 
 Garfunkel\, and a musical connection was made. Throughout the past 4 years\
 , Daniel and Jenna have been songwriting in long-distance fashion\; Daniel 
 attending university in Los Angeles while Jenna way fared her way around th
 e world\, performing whenever and wherever their paths crossed. It wasn’t u
 ntil early 2009\, after Daniel graduated college\, that he decided to join 
 Jenna in Colorado where they can finally pursue their music together\, full
  time and face to face. Both Aquarians and avid lovers of The Beatles\, Dan
 iel and Jenna come together to create Oak Creek\, a harmonic\, folk-filled\
 , energy to be reckoned with. They have been compared to the Canadian indie
 -pop band\, Stars\, as well as the folk-rock band Rilo Kiley from Los Angel
 es. Both pull influences from bands such as Fleet Foxes\, Broken Social Sce
 ne\, Phoenix\, Wilco\, Stevie Wonder\, Simon and Garfunkel\, and of course\
 , The Beatles. While Daniel already has 2 solo albums under his belt\, with

  Scott Bein (Missouri) - Guitar and Gavin Straub (Michigan) - Percussion ma
 ke up this motley group of misfits. The band attacks their music head on\, 
 layering intensely powerful vocals\, smoothly inventive guitar lines\, and

 up and the down seamlessly. The band began as a solo act with Mark Bush bac

 lorado honing his skills as a performer and paving the way the band would f
 ollow. Mark began writing and performing when he was 14. Now 33\, Mark feel

 k knows how to pull his audience into his music. No song is long enough or 
 can be played too often. And those are just the originals. With the odd cov
 er thrown in here and there\, everyone is sure to find something in their p
 erformances to sing along with. Heard anywhere from the local bar\, to the 
 coffee shops\, and the farmers market\, there is no reason you should be st
 aying home when Marks Midnight Carnival Show is playing. From Miles Davis t
 o Phantom Planet\, from Dave Mathews to Radiohead\, and somewhere in betwee

 om one to the other. The band is sure to catch the attention of everyone wh

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans native\, has spent the la
 st fifteen years living everywhere but his hometown. As songwriter and perf
 ormer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine through but his songs are 
 steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. From his years playing the 
 songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three year stint as a graduate s
 tudent in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his current home in the mountains o
 f Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs run almost as wide a gamut a
 s his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as the performer's backgroun
 d. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\, Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\,
  Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consistent thread that runs throug
 hout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and distinctively his own. In
  the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Attic biannual "shoot out" in
  Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to commit full-time to the "pe
 rforming songwriter" craft. After spending three years touring\, he took a 
 five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "daylights" as a psychotherap
 ist. Although he has no intention of quitting his day job any time soon (he
  likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided to get back out there! "Th
 ompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy breathiness\, a bit of a 
 good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothing quality that is all his 
 own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, proving himself capable of
  leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control over his vocal power. But 
 a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't mean what you sing. And l
 uckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jefferyhyde.com\nwww.myspace.com

DESCRIPTION:Fluxus:\n\nFluxus is the latest musical project led by Boulder/
 Denver based trumpet player Brian Campbell. This band draws inspiration fro
 m the jazz scene of the 1960's and 1970's\, when jazz was beginning to bran
 ch in myriad directions. Fusion became the term to express how jazz was evo
 lving and beginning to incorporate elements from any and all styles of musi
 c. So in this sense\, Fluxus could be considered a fusion band\, but they j
 ust consider themselves to be instrumental musicians that have evolved to e
 xist in 2009. In a set they may cover ground from forward thinking original
 s to Thelonious Monk\, Herbie Hancock or Radiohead\, infusing any song they
  perform with creativity and a jazz sensibility. Fluxus is a labor of love 
 that pays homage to the great music that brought these musicians together a
 nd at the same time provides a platform for the strong composition and arra
 ngement skills of the band members. The mission of Fluxus is to create musi
 c that is highly cerebral\, yet never loses it's element of entertainment a
 nd danceability. Listen and enjoy! \n\nwww.myspace.com/fluxusjazz

DESCRIPTION:Spencer Pelton:\n\n"I was raised the small town of Sevierville\
 , TN\, in the shadows of both the Great Smoky Mountains and Dolly Parton. D
 olly was everywhere. In street names\, on billboards\, in the DNA of my cla
 ssmates\, and even part of restaurant menus\, Sevierville being the only pl
 ace that I know where you can order a "Dolly-rack" of ribs. However\, the s
 imple place that Dolly Parton made millions singing about isn't so simple a
 ny more. The valleys are filled with the kitschy trappings of a Southern to
 urist economy and the mountains are being covered in ridge-top rental devel
 opment. Some have expected from me\, having been raised in the Southern App
 alachians\, a certain degree of traditional authenticity in my music\, and 
 I suppose being surrounded by the tones and textures of the music and by th
 e mountains themselves has influenced the way I write\, perform\, and perce
 ive the world. However\, it is the irony of a region robbed of its dignity 
 and forced to reduce its traditions to song and dance shows and an overall 
 disenchantment with small-town life\, love\, and politics from which I deri
 ve my biggest inspiration for writing. Other than that\, I like to think th
 at me and Ms. Parton might have a lot in common."\n\nwww.myspace.com/spence

DESCRIPTION:Ramaya:\n\nAn eclectic musician\, in search of something much g
 reater than himself\, Ramaya Soskin has been writing and performing music s
 ince 2000. Starting first at Naropa University\, he formed a trio named Spe
 cter X. While maturing as a songwriter he practiced his craft and soon star
 ted the band SLOWROSA with local songstress Cate Coslor\, Tres Altman\, Chr
 is Mustaine and Jeb Bows. The band performed with acts such as Devotchka\, 
 The Fray\, and The Czars at Boulder's "Fox" and "Boulder Theatre". The band
 s' representation\; Brian Schwartz (Dinosaur Jr. and Rose Hill Drive) was a
  great support\, but the act was unable to continue in it's present form. V
 isit myspace.com/SLOWROSA for more info. Ramaya's next project was entitled
  "A. Ballad Nightly" and included players Jack Leahy\, Jeb Bows and Jess De
 Nicola-Mefford. After a wonderful year in Boulder with this outfit Ramaya m
 oved east to New Hope P.A. and settled into a comfortable obscurity\, until
  returning in 2009 to begin again... All in all\, Ramaya and the bands he h
 as been a part of have shared evenings with: Mannequin Makeout\, Bluebook\,
  Chris Pureka\, Strangers Die Everyday\, Max Davies and Tongue Noir\, Deche
 n Hawk\, Gregory Alan Isakov & The Frieght\, Clay Rose\, The Paper Stars\, 
 Punkalele\, The Hot IQ's\, Matson Jones\, Libby Kirkpatrick\, Bright Channe
 l\, Buck 65\, County Road X\, Shanti Groove\, Porlolo\, New Dialectic\, Ian
  Cooke\, Birdie Num Num\, Eli Ward\, and many other wonderful artists... Af
 ter many incarnations without the release of a proper recording\, Ramaya fi
 nally released a debut CD of new material in November of 2007. Both hauntin
 g and revealing\, this album is a collection of delicate lullabyes\, saucy 
 rockers\, and sultry ballads. Written and recorded in his shoebox of a home
 \, it will surely make it's mark in many hearts. The new album: "All In Goo
 d Time"\, is available for purchase: Just click the link (album cover) to c
 dbaby.com. It can also be found as a download from the iTunes music store..

  bought myself a piano\, taught myself to play and wrote a bunch of songs. 
 Most of the songs I write are inspired by my real life experiences. Writing

 The sounds and the stories of The Paper Stars reflect these kinds of spaces

  album is full of these kinds of ancient books and pungent wisdom whisked f
 rom a life well travelled. The Paper Stars embody this image of the opening
  of the eyes and the taking-in of light. Illustrated otherwise\, they are a
  catalog of human emotion punctuated by visions of a man taking responsibil
 ity for what is his. And in the final chapter of this band’s provenance\, t
 his tale is about taking control and carving your own\, authentic road.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:An eclectic musician\, in search of something much greater than
  himself\, Ramaya Soskin has been writing and performing music since 2000. 
 Starting first at Naropa University\, he formed a trio named Specter X. Whi
 le maturing as a songwriter he practiced his craft and soon started the ban
 d SLOWROSA with local songstress Cate Coslor\, Tres Altman\, Chris Mustaine
  and Jeb Bows. The band performed with acts such as Devotchka\, The Fray\, 
 and The Czars at Boulder's "Fox" and "Boulder Theatre". The bands' represen
 tation\; Brian Schwartz (Dinosaur Jr. and Rose Hill Drive) was a great supp
 ort\, but the act was unable to continue in it's present form. Visit myspac
 e.com/SLOWROSA for more info. Ramaya's next project was entitled "A. Ballad
  Nightly" and included players Jack Leahy\, Jeb Bows and Jess DeNicola-Meff
 ord. After a wonderful year in Boulder with this outfit Ramaya moved east t
 o New Hope P.A. and settled into a comfortable obscurity\, until returning 
 in 2009 to begin again... All in all\, Ramaya and the bands he has been a p
 art of have shared evenings with: Mannequin Makeout\, Bluebook\, Chris Pure
 ka\, Strangers Die Everyday\, Max Davies and Tongue Noir\, Dechen Hawk\, Gr
 egory Alan Isakov & The Frieght\, Clay Rose\, The Paper Stars\, Punkalele\,
  The Hot IQ's\, Matson Jones\, Libby Kirkpatrick\, Bright Channel\, Buck 65
 \, County Road X\, Shanti Groove\, Porlolo\, New Dialectic\, Ian Cooke\, Bi
 rdie Num Num\, Eli Ward\, and many other wonderful artists... After many in
 carnations without the release of a proper recording\, Ramaya finally relea
 sed a debut CD of new material in November of 2007. Both haunting and revea
 ling\, this album is a collection of delicate lullabyes\, saucy rockers\, a
 nd sultry ballads. Written and recorded in his shoebox of a home\, it will 
 surely make it's mark in many hearts. The new album: "All In Good Time"\, i
 s available for purchase: Just click the link (album cover) to cdbaby.com. 
 It can also be found as a download from the iTunes music store...\nwww.mysp

DESCRIPTION:Missing Fundamentals formed in January 2008 when reunited high 
 school friends\, Cat and Siena\, realized they needed to combine their love
  of music and their songwriting skills to start a band! Not long after\, Si
 ena's lifelong friend and songwriting partner Erica picked up her bass and 
 joined the band. The three worked hard and soon had enough original songs t
 o play shows. After going through several drummers trying to find their per
 fect line-up\, Missing Fundamentals was finally completed when Jon replied 
 to their ad in March of 2009. Since then the band has played shows in the D
 enver/Boulder area and recorded their first official E.P.\, the M.F.E.P. Th
 eir eclectic tastes in music and different songwriting styles make Missing 
 Fundamentals a mixture of indie\, rock and folk. Blending vocal harmonies w
 ith guitar rock\, they are not quite like any other band you’ve heard. They
  are currently based in Boulder\, Colorado and are building a great fan bas

 ced by bands ranging from the British \nalt-rock of Radiohead and Coldplay 
 to classics like The Beatles and Nick Drake\, John’s \nsound synthesizes th

 ppeal to a \nwide range of listeners.  \n \nImpulsive and charismatic\, Joh

 cian\, \nturning strangers into believers one person at a time. Sharing his
  love of music with \nothers is what drives him\, bridging the gap between 
 performer and fan. Connecting to the \naudience – making it a personal expe
 rience – is what John delivers.  \n \nIn May of 2008\, John released his fu
 ll-length debut album\, “Street Spirit.” John recently \nwon “CU Idol\,” th
 e University of Colorado’s American Idol-style competition.  He was \nthe f
 eatured Acoustic/Folk artist in the January 2008 edition of the Colorado Mu

DESCRIPTION:Performing Songwriter\, Recording Artist and Teacher\, Rosh has
  been an intregal\, innovative and well loved part of both the Boulder Fron
 t Range Music Scene and around the world since 2001. Learning to play the g
 uitar at the age of ten\, Rosh grew up listening to the music of his two ol
 der brother from Blue Oyster Cult to Micheal Jackson to Van Halen to Pink F
 loyd to Bod Dyan to Alice in Chains to Grateful Dead to Nirvana to Johnny C
 ash to Radio Head\, Kreg Viesselman and countless others. He soon fell into
  the organic sounds of the acoustic steel string guitar\, learned to sing\,
  to play the piano and harmonica. An international touring musician\, Rosh’
 s leadership and commitment to creating more emotionally affluent settings 
 for his music has brought him into the homes and living rooms of fans in co
 mmunities all over the world. He has done this by offering communities the 
 opportunity to host private ‘Acoustic’ Rosh House Concert performances in t
 heir homes. House Concerts are a wonderful grassroots phenomenon where worl
 d class musicians and developing local talent alike perform in the comforta
 ble intimacy of private homes and similar non traditional spaces. Rosh has 
 been pioneering House Concerts across Iceland\, Western Europe and the USA 
 since 2004. Rosh’s songwriting at it’s best has been orchestrated with thre
 e-part harmonies\, perfectly balanced array of singer-songwriter music with
  tight rhythm sections that explore complex poly-rhythms and straight forwa
 rd funkin grooves. The moods\, melodies and rhythms of Rosh’s songs have si
 mple and powerful story. Anyone with the opportunity to hear his music has 
 truly been blessed with an insightful and inspiring view of life that will 
 awaken their hearts. \nhttp://www.myspace.com/oneeyeglassbroken

DESCRIPTION:An eclectic musician\, in search of something much greater than
  himself\, Ramaya Soskin has been writing and performing music since 2000. 
 Starting first at Naropa University\, he formed a trio named Specter X. Whi
 le maturing as a songwriter he practiced his craft and soon started the ban
 d SLOWROSA with local songstress Cate Coslor\, Tres Altman\, Chris Mustaine
  and Jeb Bows. The band performed with acts such as Devotchka\, The Fray\, 
 and The Czars at Boulder's "Fox" and "Boulder Theatre". The bands' represen
 tation\; Brian Schwartz (Dinosaur Jr. and Rose Hill Drive) was a great supp
 ort\, but the act was unable to continue in it's present form. Visit myspac
 e.com/SLOWROSA for more info. Ramaya's next project was entitled "A. Ballad
  Nightly" and included players Jack Leahy\, Jeb Bows and Jess DeNicola-Meff
 ord. After a wonderful year in Boulder with this outfit Ramaya moved east t
 o New Hope P.A. and settled into a comfortable obscurity\, until returning 
 in 2009 to begin again... All in all\, Ramaya and the bands he has been a p
 art of have shared evenings with: Mannequin Makeout\, Bluebook\, Chris Pure
 ka\, Strangers Die Everyday\, Max Davies and Tongue Noir\, Dechen Hawk\, Gr
 egory Alan Isakov & The Frieght\, Clay Rose\, The Paper Stars\, Punkalele\,
  The Hot IQ's\, Matson Jones\, Libby Kirkpatrick\, Bright Channel\, Buck 65
 \, County Road X\, Shanti Groove\, Porlolo\, New Dialectic\, Ian Cooke\, Bi
 rdie Num Num\, Eli Ward\, and many other wonderful artists... After many in
 carnations without the release of a proper recording\, Ramaya finally relea
 sed a debut CD of new material in November of 2007. Both haunting and revea
 ling\, this album is a collection of delicate lullabyes\, saucy rockers\, a
 nd sultry ballads. Written and recorded in his shoebox of a home\, it will 
 surely make it's mark in many hearts. The new album: "All In Good Time"\, i
 s available for purchase: Just click the link (album cover) to cdbaby.com. 
 It can also be found as a download from the iTunes music store...\nhttp://w

DESCRIPTION:The Ian McFeron Band broke onto the Seattle music scene shortly
  after releasing their debut album\, Don't Look Back (2003)\, when they wer
 e discovered by “The Mountain” in Seattle (AM-formatted KMTT at 103.7 FM). 
 Within months\, the first single\, Love Me Twice\, edged out songs by Modes
 t Mouse\, Bob Schneider\, The Bo Deans\, and Ray LaMontagne in The Mountain
 's "New Music Throwdown\," a weekly competition where listeners vote for th
 eir favorite of two new songs. The band went on to share the spotlight with
  international and national artists such as Patty Griffin\, Nanci Griffith\
 , Shawn Mullins\, Amos Lee\, Sister Hazel\, Missy Higgins\, Julia Fordham\,
  Carbon Leaf\, The Hothouse Flowers\, and Jars of Clay. A prolific songwrit
 er whose lyrical prose and fervent work ethic has drawn comparisons to Bob 
 Dylan and Ryan Adams\, McFeron has released a steady stream of albums: Don’
 t Look Back (2003)\, A Long Way To Freedom (2005)\, Fistfight With Father T
 ime (2006)\, and Let It Ride (2007). Love Me Blue\, McFeron's much anticipa
 ted fifth full-length LP\, was released in the Spring of 2009. Love Me Blue
  is a poetic narrative\, spanning themes of love and faith\, disillusionmen
 t and new beginnings\, threaded with a veiled sense of hope that has create
 d life-long fans out of his listeners. The band tours vigorously\, often li
 ving for months at a time in their 1970 Gillig tour bus\, reaching out to n
 ew listeners across the nation. In live performance\, McFeron (vocals\, gui
 tars\, piano) is joined by the Texas fiddle of Alisa Milner and the backbea
 t rhythms of Norman Baker and Mark Bateman. The diverse musicianship of its
  members allows the Ian McFeron Band to shift smoothly through a variety of
  roots-Americana styles\, ranging from acoustic folk-rock to gritty alt-cou
 ntry blues\, from heartfelt\, soulful ballads to driving\, danceable backbe
 at groves.\n\nwww.ianmcferon.com

DESCRIPTION:Well\, I don't have anything clever to say. And my bio won't mo
 ve mountains. It's a simple story\, a common story: I grew up in the woods 
 in Ohio and I played guitar instead of watching TV. So when my parents got 
 pissed off at me\, they'd ground me from my guitar. Which sucked. I moved t
 o NYC when I was 18 with no money\, but a collection of lyrically-intense b
 luesy songs--most with minor or dissonant chords. I played shows by myself 
 until I tripped and fell head-first into the rock scene. I started a band c
 alled Devola\, named after a section of my hometown\, and I still think we 
 kicked ass. We were rowdy. We were loud. We scared every emo band that got 
 stuck opening for us. We toured a lot. I dyed my hair dark and wore a lot o
 f eyeliner then. Devola fell apart\, as bands who are rowdy and tour a lot 
 do\, and now I've taken everything I learned from being in a scary band and
  infused my bluesy\, still intense\, still minor\, still dissonant music wi
 th that knowledge.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/elizabethsound

DESCRIPTION:Almost Legends is a band whose wide range of influences\, from 
 Rush to John Mayer\, to the Jazz and Blues greats of old\, drive their fres
 h funky new blend of rock and roll. Singer/guitarist Dustin Reed\, drummer 
 Jake Euler\, and bassist Zach Flower formed the band the summer of 2008. At
  their first show\, Almost Legends wowed audiences at CU Boulder's Battle o
 f the Bands by placing first. Ever since\, they have been performing and ga
 ining momentum. Almost Legends released the EP\, "Our Lives in Notes" in Fe
 bruary 2009 and began turning heads with their unique blending of styles. T
 he recent addition of bassist Chris Cash brings a new energy and a funky fr
 esh flavor to the group. They are currently working on an extensive summer 
 tour and a full length debut album. Almost Legends is a coming home of sort
 s for these three. They try to blend all of the music that they love into a
  sound uniquely theirs\, a little funk\, a little rock\, and a little blues
 . Most importantly\, they play what they want to. Almost Legends just wants
  its audience to have fun\, because they love what they do\, and it shows.\

DESCRIPTION:Jesse Manley was born in Montana and spent his early childhood 
 on an expansive ranch just north of Yellowstone National Park. The history 
 and raw folklore of the area continue to influence his music to this day. J
 esse’s musical style was shaped by listening to his father both play tradit
 ional folk music and recite verse from Robert Service’s epic poetry. While 
 Jesse had dabbled in playing music\, it wasn’t until his senior year of col
 lege that he discovered his passion for songwriting. \n\nSince moving to th
 e Denver area in 2001\, Jesse has honed his musical and compositional skill
 s into those of a “mature songwriter with a well-developed style (Eric Eyl\
 , Westword).” He is currently working on his first album (collaborating wit
 h Dave Willey)\, and has recently begun playing out. Eric Eyl of the Westwo
 rd says\, “I was instantly captivated by Manley’s songs and sounds” and his
  “…earnest lyrics\, dreamy melodies\, and a truly unique voice.” \n\nwww.my

DESCRIPTION:Cain & Annabelle\, a southern folk/roots music duo\, claim the 
 foothills of the Appalachians as their home. The two met as wandering music
 ians and quickly discovered an undeniable musical chemistry. Upon returning
  from their travels\, they went their separate ways for a time until they w
 ere once again called home to the mountains. In the winter of 2008/2009 'Ca
 in & Annabelle' was born as the two musicians collaborated\, pouring their 
 hearts and souls into their songs. Their debut EP 'The Lake Takes' (to be r
 eleased in April) was self recorded in a small lake cabin one snowy week in
  Janurary. Since then\, the two have been making music non-stop\, whenever 
 and wherever they can. Cain was raised in Tennessee and North Carolina and 
 on country\, bluegrass\, and good ol' rock and roll music. Although he didn
 't begin playing an instrument till the age of 19\, he always knew that mus
 ic would be more to him than just playing DJ with his parents old vinyl rec
 ords as he did at the age of 6. Annabelle was raised in Tennessee in a hous
 ehold surrounded by music. Folk music and bluegrass was always a part of he
 r life as a musician. She doesn't remember not being able to play the piano
  and inherited the gift of hearing harmony from her grandmother\, a singer\
 , who would sing to her on the front porch. These two troubadours\, despite
  their varied musical backgrounds\, hope that together\, they will have muc
 h to offer the world in the way of good\, honest\, lyrics\, heartfelt melod
 ies\, and songs that will stand the test of time.\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com

DESCRIPTION:T’was the dark year of our Lord\, 1775. King George III had jus
 t dispatched a fleet of his finest ships to snuff the rebellion abroad. Whe
 n the dawn of October 30th broke on Captain George Duff\, he and his men we
 re just 100 miles out of Liverpool in the Celtic Sea. A deckhand called the
  Captain’s attention to the mast of black ship about a quarter mile off the
 ir port side. Young master Johnny\, the cabin boy\, strained through his sp
 yglass to see if the ensign bore the Jolly Roger\, or perhaps it was Irish 
 Navy. But as the massive old ship drew nearer\, Johnny saw the ensign clear
 ly\, and it was one he had never seen before. An hour glass with angel wing
 s was pinned to the tattered old rag of a flag with brick red pigment that 
 seemed to drip like murder from the canvas. As Johnny panned the spyglass t
 oward the deck\, he heard wisps of voices on the wind. Singing? Yes it was\
 ; and how haunting at that. Like a corpse whispering promises through a flu
 te made of bone. And then Johnny saw the figure head\; a siren carved in eb
 ony\, the size of a Requiem Shark. Her eyes were deep and hollow\, her hair
  seemed to move with the nature of eels\, and a dark scarlet ink ran from h
 er lips over the plaque she held in her spindly fingers. And on the plaque\
 ; Johnny strained to read… inlaid with bone\, in a merciless font\, stood t
 he words\, “The Widow’s Bane.” In an instant\, the ship had swung broadside
  and before Johnny could speak\, he saw a series of flashes emit from the s
 hip’s port holes. There was a sound not unlike that of the earth itself bei
 ng torn asunder\, and then poor Johnny heard no more. Come that evening\, t
 he crimson waves left in the wake of The Widow’s Bane\, reached all the way
  back to Liverpool. And while this spectacle was certainly shocking to the 
 fishermen that soaked their trousers in it\, this account is only unique in
  the names of crew members and geographical locations. Apart from that\, th
 is story has been a part of almost every port town’s history across the glo
 be for the last three hundred years. Indeed\, to this day\, if a sailor hea
 rs that mournful tune on the high seas\, he will know his options of fate a
 re slim. If he has been a God fearing man and said his prayers\, he will li
 kely sleep in a watery grave that eve. However\, if he has lived his life b
 y the Devil’s standards\, his fate is sure to be far worse\; an endless voy
 age of murder and mayhem\, singing for his bread\, and living among the dea
 d\, upon The Widow’s Bane. \n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/widowsbane

DESCRIPTION:Her feet dangling from her daddy's overalls\, Cindy Woolf was i
 ntroduced to music by George Woolf and an old C.F. Martin Guitar from the f
 oothills of the Ozark Mountains. Long before she discovered a penchant for 
 love songs\, train songs and travel songs\, Cindy's earliest memories were 
 of her daddy hauling her around in his overalls while he picked that Martin
 . She started piano at four\, learned hymns from Granny on her front porch 
 swing\, then crossed genres again with her punk/pop band\, 3 Apples High\, 
 in high school. "I just jumped around and sang\," she said. A tape was born
 e\, but so was an idea: "I fell in love with performing on stage."\n\nFrom 
 punk Pixies covers to canned and uncanny vocals\, Cindy Woolf - "all sugar 
 and molasses" - has since asserted herself as one of the most creative and 
 thoughtful singer/songwriters working today. Difficult to define\, Cindy's 
 music has been called Americana\, country\, folk\, pop and - her favorite -
  "hillbilly love-pop."\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/cindywoolf\n\n$5.00 cover\

DESCRIPTION:Somewhere between indie and folk\, between poetry and introspec
 tive musings\, one finds Tenebrae\, whose title -- Latin for shadows -- per
 fectly sums up the feel of this set. The album revolves around relationship
 s and the emotions that feed and sap them\, of those who want out\, those w
 ho want in\, and those who are torn between leaving and staying. Conflict b
 etween lovers is the set's thematic crux\, the "Great Divide" that Mike Man
 gione is forever attempting to bestride\, the details of which are mostly s
 ketchy\, but the repercussions and emotions they evoke as sharp as glass. A
 nd it's those emotions that wash strongest over the set\, although the lyri
 cs linger. Like all good poetry\, one's meant to luxuriate in the beauty of
  their structure\, the lovely twist of the words\, and the hidden meanings 
 occasionally found within. The music provides plenty of scope to immerse on
 eself in the vocals\; it's a sublime backdrop that provides support for\, b
 ut never overshadows\, the lyrics. The warmth of the sound\, the shadowed m
 elodies\, the rhythms that add urgency to the words\, and the depths of moo
 d the strings subtly add\, all feed the pensive air of the set. A sublime a
 lbum to be enjoyed at leisure\, a late night pleasure or rainy afternoon de
 light. ~ Jo-Ann Greene\, All Music Guide\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/mikemang

 on an expansive ranch just north of Yellowstone National Park. The history 
 and raw folklore of the area continue to influence his music to this day. J

DESCRIPTION:Before open mics\, before showcase slots\, and before the hype\
 , there was the traveling folk singer. Woody Guthrie\, Ramblin Jack\, Leadb
 elly\, and others traveled the country armed with nothing but a guitar and 
 a head full of songs. And while the tradition has long been shadowed by the
  ever growing music industry\, the folk singer is still out there. John Cra
 igie is one. Doing his best to keep the tradition alive\, he travels from t
 own to town\, telling stories and singing songs. Some nights to a crowded h
 ouse\, some nights for two people. His songs and stories cover the spectrum
  of human emotion. Some funny\, some sad\, some bitter and some sweet. With
  his roots style\, Craigie has been gaining a cult following throughout the
  country. Despite the lack of any of the tools of the modern aggressively p
 opular musician\, his music continues to spread. \n\nThere will be no hype\
 , no exaggeration. No blurb from some magazine/person youve never heard of 
 telling you what "next thing" he is. No pushy manager telling you to go out
  to the shows. Just the music and the performances. We'll see you out on th
 e road. \n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/johncraigie\n\n$5 cover

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans native\, has spent the la
 st fifteen years living everywhere but his hometown. As songwriter and perf
 ormer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine through but his songs are 
 steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. From his years playing the 
 songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three year stint as a graduate s
 tudent in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his current home in the mountains o
 f Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs run almost as wide a gamut a
 s his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as the performer's backgroun
 d. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\, Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\,
  Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consistent thread that runs throug
 hout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and distinctively his own. In
  the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Attic biannual "shoot out" in
  Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to commit full-time to the "pe
 rforming songwriter" craft. After spending three years touring\, he took a 
 five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "daylights" as a psychotherap
 ist. Although he has no intention of quitting his day job any time soon (he
  likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided to get back out there! "Th
 ompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy breathiness\, a bit of a 
 good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothing quality that is all his 
 own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, proving himself capable of
  leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control over his vocal power. But 
 a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't mean what you sing. And l
 uckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jefferyhyde.com\nwww.myspace.com

DESCRIPTION:The trio\, comprised of Tierney Kathleen (vocals/guitar)\, Nich
 olas Dunbar (vocals/mandolin)\, and Gary McCrumb (vocals/upright bass)\, ma
 de their debut in the summer of 2007. It was a sunny evening in June\, on A
 pple Valley Road\, and the music could be heard on the banks of the Saint V
 rain River. The band\, later named “Apple Valley” for their original perfor
 mance just outside of Lyons\, Colorado\, live in the Nederland/Lyons areas 
 and are surely making their impact on the Colorado bluegrass world.  \nAppl
 e Valley’s unique sound is due to their blend of acoustic\, bluegrass\, and
  folk music with sincerely crafted and arranged original and traditional so
 ngs. Not to mention\, Tierney’s beautiful and soothing voice is a sound tha
 t comes straight off the front porch\, out onto the plains and into the hea
 rts of listeners everywhere. The band is influenced by many\, both great an
 d small\, including: Bill Monroe\, John Prine\, Jerry Garcia\, David Grisma
 n\, Tim O’Brien\, Bob Dylan\, and Gillian Welch to name a few. Apple Valley
 ’s music can be heard all along the Front Range of Colorado as their fan ba
 se is ever-growing. Recently\, Apple Valley opened for Greensky Bluegrass a
 t the Oriental Theater in Denver. \nThe band currently has a self-recorded 
 and released LP titled\, “Blackbox Sessions”\, which can be purchased at th
 eir shows. They also have a developing plan for an album release in the nea
 r future.  With the recent addition of a female fiddle player\, MinTze Wu\,
  who currently performs with the Boulder Chamber Orchestra and San Diego Sy
 mphony\, Apple Valley’s future is looking bright. While their music continu
 es to grace the fields\, barns\, rivers and buildings\, Apple Valley is sti
 ll singing on their porches\, and appreciating the love and support of all 
 the venues\, friends and fans\, and drawing inspiration from the wide surro
 unding musical community.\n\nwww.myspace.com/applevalleymusic

DESCRIPTION:Villains Trust is a band focused on music. Formed in Syracuse\,
  NY this jam-rock quartet is the long harbored dream of front man/singer/so
 ngwriter Mikey Powell come to fruition. \n\nHailing from Carthage\, NY\, Po
 well\, a former Syracuse University and currently professional lacrosse sta
 r with the Boston Cannons\, has captured world-wide attention with his outs
 tanding athletic abilities\, eccentric style and fan appeal. Yet despite th
 e accolades of the sports world\, one of Mike's deepest passions\, his musi
 c\, has sat on the back burner. ...... until now. \n\nHaving discovered and
  enlisted the talents of three Syracuse-native musicians -John Hanus (Lead 
 Guitar)\, Joe Bell (Bass Guitar)\, Lewk Detor (drums) -the time has come fo
 r Powell's creative impulses to find a powerful outlet. \n\nTogether this p
 romising outfit has taken their individual talents and a broad spectrum of 
 influences\, and woven a tapestry of sonic power around Powell's soulful vo
 ice and story-telling lyrical style. \n\nVillains Trust's music is an amalg
 am of the varied styles of the band members. The backbone of V.T. is it's r
 hythm section. Together Bell and Detor bring a potent dose of jazz\, funk\,
  and heavy rock styles to the mix and lay a steady foundation on which Powe
 ll can lay down his rhythm guitar work and moving\, emotive singing. Yet\, 
 this collaboration would not be complete without the sweeping\, and soaring
 \, weeping and roaring guitar playing of John Hanus who wields his guitar l
 ike a paintbrush -bringing vivid\, colorful\, accents into the picture. \n\

DESCRIPTION:An eclectic musician\, in search of something much greater than
  himself\, Ramaya Soskin has been writing and performing music since 2000. 
 Starting first at Naropa University\, he formed a trio named Specter X. Whi
 le maturing as a songwriter he practiced his craft and soon started the ban
 d SLOWROSA with local songstress Cate Coslor\, Tres Altman\, Chris Mustaine
  and Jeb Bows. The band performed with acts such as Devotchka\, The Fray\, 
 and The Czars at Boulder's "Fox" and "Boulder Theatre". The bands' represen
 tation\; Brian Schwartz (Dinosaur Jr. and Rose Hill Drive) was a great supp
 ort\, but the act was unable to continue in it's present form. Visit myspac
 e.com/SLOWROSA for more info. Ramaya's next project was entitled "A. Ballad
  Nightly" and included players Jack Leahy\, Jeb Bows and Jess DeNicola-Meff
 ord. After a wonderful year in Boulder with this outfit Ramaya moved east t
 o New Hope P.A. and settled into a comfortable obscurity\, until returning 
 in 2009 to begin again... All in all\, Ramaya and the bands he has been a p
 art of have shared evenings with: Mannequin Makeout\, Bluebook\, Chris Pure
 ka\, Strangers Die Everyday\, Max Davies and Tongue Noir\, Dechen Hawk\, Gr
 egory Alan Isakov & The Frieght\, Clay Rose\, The Paper Stars\, Punkalele\,
  The Hot IQ's\, Matson Jones\, Libby Kirkpatrick\, Bright Channel\, Buck 65
 \, County Road X\, Shanti Groove\, Porlolo\, New Dialectic\, Ian Cooke\, Bi
 rdie Num Num\, Eli Ward\, and many other wonderful artists... After many in
 carnations without the release of a proper recording\, Ramaya finally relea
 sed a debut CD of new material in November of 2007. Both haunting and revea
 ling\, this album is a collection of delicate lullabyes\, saucy rockers\, a
 nd sultry ballads. Written and recorded in his shoebox of a home\, it will 
 surely make it's mark in many hearts. The new album: "All In Good Time"\, i
 s available for purchase: Just click the link (album cover) to cdbaby.com. 
 It can also be found as a download from the iTunes music store...\nhttp://w

DESCRIPTION:About Shannon Curtis\nWhen Shannon Curtis was 5\, she danced an
 d sang along to her dad playing 40’s-era standards on her family’s baby gra
 nd.\n\nWhen she was 7\, her classical piano teacher told her she played lik
 e a boy.\n\nWhen she was 9\, she sang into her hairbrush pretending to be A
 my Grant.\n\nJust out of college\, she shirked her pre-med Biology degree a
 nd made an earnest effort as the lead singer in a guitar-based rock band.\n
 \nThree years ago she found her piano again\, started writing love songs\, 
 and quit the band. Since then she says it’s been like walking around in an 
 old\, comfortable pair of shoes – playing the piano and singing songs about
  love.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times describes Shannon as "... a beautiful piano
  player who sounds like the love child of Fiona Apple and Norah Jones."\n\n
 Shannon's debut EP\, Boomerangs & Seesaws\, was released in July 2007 on th
 e tiny Saint Cloud Records label\, and the follow up\, Paris Can't Have You
 \, was released in March 2008. Constant touring and placements in TV and fi
 lm have been building Shannon a devoted following across the country.\n\nht

DESCRIPTION:Yeye Organic Pop \n\nI\, Yeye\, singer/ songwriter Yésica Pined
 a\, naturally embraced the journey of MUSIC\, like every other musician\, a
 t the very young age of 5 years old. Being 20\, I was chosen as a "Valor Ju
 venil" (Mexican Idol) by Televisa International TV Chain. \n\nThrough my ex
 perience of sound\, playing instruments and singing\, I learned that all in
  the Universe is vibration\, and vibration has the quality to harmonize and
  create\, or to disharmonize and disrupt.\n\nGrowing up I went through the 
 phases of music style that appealed to my level of awareness about being hu
 man between humans and the importance we\, as people\, give to the recognit
 ion and praise given by others\; which eventually lead me to the search of 
 the self and becoming comfortable in my own skin without judgments or expec
 tations.\n\nThis discovery opened doors\; opportunities to collaborate with
  first level talent became available. I played\, recorded and performed liv
 e with famous musicians while living in the city of Los Angeles. I followed
  the professional path into the industry\, did my work writing songs and re
 corded a Pop album with well known producers Rafita Esparza-Ruiz and 10 tim
 es Grammy winner Rafa Sardina. \n\nWhen I presented my album in front of 15
 \,000 people I was forced to do a playback (singing with the tracks on) and
  ended going through a CD Skip that made it obvious to the public we were f
 ollowing a recording. I retreated\, went into meditation about the world an
 d the meaning of being who you are.\n\nToday\, I live in Boulder\, teach an
 d study Yoga\, write for Elephantjournal.com\, study healing practices and 
 came back to my music\, embracing that which defines me. I call my style Or
 ganic Pop\, you can hear my producers work in our album "Algo de mi"\, rele
 ased for sale at all digital retailers. Currently\, I am writing new music 
 to record and perform\, which I identify as Organic Underground Healing Sou
 nds\, collaborating with Something Underground\, Kimba Arem\, Rob& Rebecca 
 Gordon\, Satchel and John\, exploring the fusion of pop music and healing s
 ounds\, 440 hz tunning and 432 hz tunning.\n\nAfter questioning myself abou
 t how I let others use my talent as the instrument of their own ambitions\,
  finally I realized that the true musician is the hierophant of the Univers
 e who elevates humanity awareness/consciousness/vibration through the heali
 ng power of tone. Music.\n\n(http://www.reverbnation.com/yeyeorganicpop)

DESCRIPTION:In early January 2006\, adorned in poor-fitting\, borrowed busi
 ness casual\, Dylan Sneed slumped in a cubicle of a cold office building in
  downtown Dallas\, TX. Two years and 35\,000 miles later\, Dylan has become
  a full-fledged road warrior\, and one of Dallas' "A-list area tunesmiths" 
 (Dallas Observer). After escaping his corporate confines he booked three na
 tional tours over '06 and '07 the grassroots way\, making friends and fans 
 one at a time across the country. The Dallas Observer praised his 2007 EP N
 o Worse For The Wear as “one of the best local releases of the year.” Produ
 ced by Steven Collins of Deadman\, the Fort Worth Weekly dubbed Sneed's fou
 rth release "epic." In September 2008 Dylan embarked on his most ambitious 
 tour yet. This "Texodus" brought Dylan and all his worldly possessions out 
 to his new home of Hartsville\, SC. He continues to tour throughout the U.S
 .\, both as a solo artist and a sideman for Brian Vander Ark (The Verve Pip
 e) and Texas songwriter Kristy Kruger. He plans to release a new album in 2
 009.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information on the Texodus tour and other D

DESCRIPTION:Born in Chicago to a chemical engineer and an architect\, Steph
 anie Nilles began playing music of various genres by sheer accident. Since 
 beginning to play the piano at the age of 6\, she has been rejected from an
 d/or kicked out of and/or never showed up at the following institutions: Th
 e Juilliard School\, Curtis Institute of Music\, Aspen Music School and Fes
 tival\, Mannes School of Music\, Steven’s Point Suzuki Workshop\, and the C
 eora Jaffe Progressive Chamber Music Experience. She does not “do drugs\,” 
 but if she does\, she tends to hallucinate in crayon. If you upset her\, sh
 e will probably bite you. If you try to hug her or touch her hair\, she wil
 l also probably bite you. She is obsessed with quantum physics and subseque
 ntly has become interested in disproving global warming and [unrelated] und
 erstanding the workings of the atomic bomb. At the very least\, she maintai
 ns Al Gore’s Nobel Prize will be revoked by the year 2012. While she does n
 ot believe that laughter is the best medicine\, she does agree that it is c
 ontagious. In early 2001\, she spent a good deal of time hanging around con
 venience stores and train stations and ever-so-slightly moved cars whose ow
 ners left keys in the ignition. This method\, later dubbed “Grand-Relocatio
 n-Auto\,” halted in early 2002 when a police-car-related incident outside a
  Westside Chicago Dunkin Donuts nearly resulted in an arrest. She is afraid
  only of Glam Asians and very small sharp objects (especially in combinatio
 n)\, and she is perhaps best described as a cross between Mother Theresa an
 d Stephen Colbert. But not.\nwww.cdbaby.com/cd/stephanienilles\n\nwww.myspa

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans native\, has spent the la
 st fifteen years living everywhere but his hometown. As songwriter and perf
 ormer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine through but his songs are 
 steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. From his years playing the 
 songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three year stint as a graduate s
 tudent in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his current home in the mountains o
 f Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs run almost as wide a gamut a
 s his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as the performer's backgroun
 d. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\, Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\,
  Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consistent thread that runs throug
 hout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and distinctively his own. In
  the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Attic biannual "shoot out" in
  Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to commit full-time to the "pe
 rforming songwriter" craft. After spending three years touring\, he took a 
 five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "daylights" as a psychotherap
 ist. Although he has no intention of quitting his day job any time soon (he
  likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided to get back out there! "Th
 ompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy breathiness\, a bit of a 
 good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothing quality that is all his 
 own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, proving himself capable of
  leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control over his vocal power. But 
 a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't mean what you sing. And l
 uckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jefferyhyde.com\nwww.myspace.com

DESCRIPTION:With influences ranging from Beck to the Dan the Automator\, Ne
 ptune’s Only Daughter’s eclectic sound has come to be defined by the mélang
 e of inspiration and experimentation in which individual members indulge. T
 he band's edgy sound seems reminiscent of jangly brit-pop and post-punk ene
 rgy\, but with the layering and soundscaping of modern electronic explorati
 on. Somewhere between Talking Heads and TV on the Radio they find a home\, 
 pushing conventions and breaking the classic rock stereotype of the Boulder
  music scene. David “Doctor Disco” Weaver\, described as humble\, well-roun
 ded\, and a general menace to the peace and quietude of society\, derives h
 is definitive\, if surprising\, rhythmic style from some of the most formid
 able names in the business of percussion. Specifically\, Dave Grohl\, Tony 
 Allen\, ?uestlove\, and Ringo Starr to name a few. Charles McCandless finds
  his strength in the rhythmic foundations to which his instrumentation is m
 ost conducive. With fingers long abused by the thick-wound coils of electri
 c bass\, he provides solid rhythms upon which a melody can develop a comfor
 table lifestyle and raise a family. Guy de Lonx\, the main songwriter of th
 e group\, takes pride in his vast array of instrumentation\, from keyboard 
 to guitar. Drawing his guitar sound from the works of Sonic Youth\, Joy Div
 ision\, the Strokes\, Jonny Marr\, and Jonathan Greenwood\, he explores the
  boundaries of his instrument with little reservations and regard. With voc
 als most aptly compared to a Win Butler/Alexander Kapranos mutant\, he warb
 les with wit and a dissolving composure. Neptune’s Only Daughter is proud t
 o collaborate with other local musicians and groups. For booking\, contact

DESCRIPTION:An eclectic musician\, in search of something much greater than
  himself\, Ramaya Soskin has been writing and performing music since 2000. 
 Starting first at Naropa University\, he formed a trio named Specter X. Whi
 le maturing as a songwriter he practiced his craft and soon started the ban
 d SLOWROSA with local songstress Cate Coslor\, Tres Altman\, Chris Mustaine
  and Jeb Bows. The band performed with acts such as Devotchka\, The Fray\, 
 and The Czars at Boulder's "Fox" and "Boulder Theatre". The bands' represen
 tation\; Brian Schwartz (Dinosaur Jr. and Rose Hill Drive) was a great supp
 ort\, but the act was unable to continue in it's present form. Visit myspac
 e.com/SLOWROSA for more info. Ramaya's next project was entitled "A. Ballad
  Nightly" and included players Jack Leahy\, Jeb Bows and Jess DeNicola-Meff
 ord. After a wonderful year in Boulder with this outfit Ramaya moved east t
 o New Hope P.A. and settled into a comfortable obscurity\, until returning 
 in 2009 to begin again... All in all\, Ramaya and the bands he has been a p
 art of have shared evenings with: Mannequin Makeout\, Bluebook\, Chris Pure
 ka\, Strangers Die Everyday\, Max Davies and Tongue Noir\, Dechen Hawk\, Gr
 egory Alan Isakov & The Frieght\, Clay Rose\, The Paper Stars\, Punkalele\,
  The Hot IQ's\, Matson Jones\, Libby Kirkpatrick\, Bright Channel\, Buck 65
 \, County Road X\, Shanti Groove\, Porlolo\, New Dialectic\, Ian Cooke\, Bi
 rdie Num Num\, Eli Ward\, and many other wonderful artists... After many in
 carnations without the release of a proper recording\, Ramaya finally relea
 sed a debut CD of new material in November of 2007. Both haunting and revea
 ling\, this album is a collection of delicate lullabyes\, saucy rockers\, a
 nd sultry ballads. Written and recorded in his shoebox of a home\, it will 
 surely make it's mark in many hearts. The new album: "All In Good Time"\, i
 s available for purchase: Just click the link (album cover) to cdbaby.com.

DESCRIPTION:Creating A Newsense\nCreating A Newsense- a dynamic rock/countr
 y band based in Manitou Springs\, Colorado- formed in 2004 with the intenti
 on of bringing soulful music back to the foothills of Colorado Springs. Aft
 er years of hard work and the culmination of ambitious creativity\, the ban
 d has created over fifty original songs which range from soft country balla
 ds to psychedelic face melting rock and roll. They have established a signi
 ficant fan base in the Colorado region and have made a name for themselves 
 among other respected musicians. Over the years\, Creating A Newsense has p
 erformed with Split Lip Rayfield\, Blue Mountain\, Martha Scanlon\, The Bit
 tersweets\, Ollabelle\, Phix\, Michael Glabicki of Rusted Root and many oth
 ers. They have also played several local and regional festivals and took st
 age at the nationally recognized Wakarusa Festival in Kansas in 2008.\nOne 
 aspect of Creating A Newsense that makes them stand out from other bands is
  their live performance. Currently\, the band has two albums available: Liv
 e at Lee Fest recorded in June 2007 and Pine Gables recorded in April 2008.
  According to the Colorado Springs Gazette\, these albums are "party starte
 rs" and give listeners a feel for the intense energy and excitement that ex
 ists at a Creating A Newsense show. In fact\, the Gazette was so impressed 
 with the band's live performance on these albums and in person that they na
 med Creating A Newsense the Best Local Band of 2008. \nCurrently\, Creating
  A Newsense is busy recording in the studio. They are working on two differ
 ent albums which will showcase the diversity of the band's repertoire. The 
 first one will be dedicated to the country and Americana inspired songs whi
 le the second will feature the harder rock and roll pieces. The band feels 
 that releasing two albums simultaneously will appeal to more listeners and 
 give fans the option to choose the musical elements of Creating A Newsense 
 that they love most. These albums are due to be released in Spring 2009.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans native\, has spent the la
 st fifteen years living everywhere but his hometown. As songwriter and perf
 ormer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine through but his songs are 
 steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. From his years playing the 
 songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three year stint as a graduate s
 tudent in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his current home in the mountains o
 f Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs run almost as wide a gamut a
 s his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as the performer's backgroun
 d. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\, Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\,
  Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consistent thread that runs throug
 hout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and distinctively his own. In
  the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Attic biannual "shoot out" in
  Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to commit full-time to the "pe
 rforming songwriter" craft. After spending three years touring\, he took a 
 five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "daylights" as a psychotherap
 ist. Although he has no intention of quitting his day job any time soon (he
  likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided to get back out there! "Th
 ompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy breathiness\, a bit of a 
 good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothing quality that is all his 
 own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, proving himself capable of
  leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control over his vocal power. But 
 a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't mean what you sing. And l
 uckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jefferyhyde.com\nwww.myspace.com

DESCRIPTION:Headliner: The Additives\nSpare time\, a spare room\, and spare
 d smokes\; like a cool-handed stage direction in a Sam Shepard play\; like 
 a grit-paced mood-swing in a Larry Brown novel\, these are the elements to 
 a truly American alchemy. These are also the ingredients that gave rise to 
 a fresh blend of alt-country\, indie rock and folk blues: The Additives\, a
  band from Bridgeport\, Chicago\; with an uncanny ability to create visual 
 narratives out of the alienation and the outsider braininess that are the m
 akeup of today's Americana tradition.\n\nHearing The Additives for the firs
 t time\, one gets the notion that the Big Song through which American music
  ventures has become more interesting\, and a shit-load cooler. \n\nThe Add
 itives’ second release\, Should It End\, plays out as all great sophomore e
 fforts should: not only is it a significant step up in production quality f
 rom the home recordings of Back In Bridgeport\, but it is also a solid indi
 cation of a songwriter and band melding into a singular voice\, one of musi
 cal adventure and lyrical penetration\; a voice in the midst of absorbing t
 he human condition with eyes wise to our foolish hearts.\n\nThis time aroun
 d\, instead of recording in the spare room of Joe and Sheila's apartment\, 
 they recruited the services of Oscar Salinas and Mike Czazwiczs to capture 
 the band’s expanding journey. \n\nThe Additives hunkered down at the Cro's 
 Nest studios for five straight days of recording in September of 2008\, whe
 re unseasonably high temperatures and an AC unit on the fritz kept the stud
 io temperatures hovering in the mid 90's. \n\nKnowing this\, the title cut 
 sets an interesting tone – you can almost feel the opening of the players’ 
 pores\, and you’re soon made to wonder whether it’s the hot air that’s caus
 ing those bodies to try and cool\, or whether it’s the only other cause for
  a human dripping sweat: nerve stimulation. \n\nFrom there the mood swagger
 s into the smirked notes of “Sad & Wonderful\,” deepens in empathy through 
 the contemplative bridges of “Lookin’ Out\,” taunts mischievously via the o
 minous shakery of “Kind of Girl” – with each song amongst these playing tou
 chstone for a songwriting whose horizons are being spread directly inside t
 he nucleus of authenticity.\n\nShould It End invites the music fan and musi
 c critic alike to search into that exalted mystery of how music and words m
 ove us. The Additives have created an experience that is sure to leave the 
 listener’s soul gratified and his or her judgment singing. \n\nWith the rel
 ease of Should It End one gets the notion that The Additives are positionin
 g to become a true American influence.\nwww.myspace.com/joeryanmrbridgeport

DESCRIPTION:Headliners: Drums & Guns\nWith a voice too sweet for sorrow cha
 rged with songs almost too revealing for lovers\, Boulder singer-songwriter
  Kate Jaworski creates music that is both personal and impactful. A deep un
 derstanding of the human condition informs her vision\, guides her soulful 
 melodies\, and fills her singing with a beauty that is immediately endearin
 g and convincing. Poured out over the subtle and intricate textures of her 
 able band\, graceful melodies alternately stimulate and soothe - giving voi
 ce to the harmony and conflict that are inseparable components of passionat
 e human experience. Influences from folk\, jazz\, and classical styles come
  together to form unique and original shapes in the music\, while the artfu
 l accompaniment by the rest of Pines of Rome maintains the focus and clarit
 y of sound and emotion that have come to define her songs.\n\nmyspace.com/k
 atejaworski\n\nOpener: Diane French\nAfter studying classical music for 15 
 years\, Diane French dropped music completely\, vowing never to play anothe
 r note. It wasn't until 10 years later that she became friends with several
  artists - musicians\, writers and painters - who inspired her to consider 
 a return to music. At an instore performance by recording artist Jim White\
 , French bought a cheap electric guitar that he was selling. He told her th
 at he'd only sell it to her if she promised to write songs with it. \n\nShe
  taught herself to play the ruby-red Fender rip-off held together with mask
 ing tape as a re-initiation into music. "Because I never had any idea what 
 I was doing\, I ended up stumbling into places that felt very interesting t
 o me\," she says. "I still write that way." \n\nIn 1999 French released her
  first recording\, the self-produced "Egg And Anvil Sketches". The sparsely
  produced six song EP reveals the intimacy of French's intoxicating vocal s
 tyle and intelligent lyrics. With her second release "No Cool Bone"\, Frenc
 h teamed up with drummer John Vecchiarelli and guitarist Todd Ayers for a f
 uller sound\, including a performance by experimental jazz trumpet-player R
 on Miles. Her latest release\, "This Trick" is her most fully realized grou
 p of songs to date. Performing Songwriter Magazine calls it "soulful"\, "ci
 nematic" and "mezmerizing."\nhttp://dianefrenchmusic.com/\n

 i encourage everyone with an appreciation of music to give her a close\, in
 timate listen" Guy Erickson\, kgnu " ...Her skilled use of dynamics first d
 raws the audience close\, and then hooks us with a display of range and pow
 er that is surprising for one so petite. Rebecca's expressive guitar playin
 g proves up to the task of matching her considerable vocal gifts..." Mike U
 srey\, talent booker \, Canon Mine Coffee My story: There is a little house
  with a large front yard that sits between two large houses. In that front 
 yard was a little brick fire ring were my family would sit singing and laug
 hing. Oh we would sing Bob Dylan's "Blowing in the Wind"\, almost any John 
 Denver tune and "Rock My Soul". That house still sits there - the fire ring
 - i'm sure has been taken down\; but in my heart that fire ring\, the laugh
 ing\, and the singing are alive as could be. This is were i learned how to 
 fly. Today i sit around playing my own songs\, and instead of my mom strumm
 ing the guitar\, its me. I like to think i have a sound all my own although
  some friends in the audience have mentioned that i sound like Jewel\, Emi 
 Lou Harris or Buffy Saint Marie. What inspires me most about playing and li
 stening to music is the expression of the heart\; Pouring oneself into the 
 song and surrendering to something greater. After a show one evening a man 
 handed me a dollar bill and on it was some beautiful lettering reading "Pas
 sion Folk". How sweet it was to be seen that way. The journey of the singer
 /songwriter can be a bitter sweet but when someone gets it\, really gets it
 \,there is nothing greater then sharing a moment of authentic bliss.\n\nwww

DESCRIPTION:Jeffery Hyde Thompson\, a New Orleans native\, has spent the la
 st fifteen years living everywhere but his hometown. As songwriter and perf
 ormer\, Jeffery's New Orleans roots always shine through but his songs are 
 steeped in themes and imagery from his travels. From his years playing the 
 songwriter circuit in the Southeast to his three year stint as a graduate s
 tudent in Transpersonal Psychology\, to his current home in the mountains o
 f Boulder\, Colorado\, the themes of his songs run almost as wide a gamut a
 s his travels. The music itself is as eclectic as the performer's backgroun
 d. Influences are easy to hear... Joni Mitchell\, Nick Drake\, Ellis Paul\,
  Martin Sexton\, Jeff Buckley... but the consistent thread that runs throug
 hout Hyde's work is that it is all thoroughly and distinctively his own. In
  the summer of 2000\, when he won the Eddie's Attic biannual "shoot out" in
  Decatur\, Georgia\, Jeffery finally decided to commit full-time to the "pe
 rforming songwriter" craft. After spending three years touring\, he took a 
 five year hiatus to go to grad school and now "daylights" as a psychotherap
 ist. Although he has no intention of quitting his day job any time soon (he
  likes it!)\, he misses the road and has decided to get back out there! "Th
 ompson's voice contains a little of Sting's jazzy breathiness\, a bit of a 
 good scatman's spontaneity and a smooth\, soothing quality that is all his 
 own. He can quickly turn the calm into a storm\, proving himself capable of
  leaping octaves and maintaining amazing control over his vocal power. But 
 a great voice isn't nearly as potent if you don't mean what you sing. And l
 uckily\, Thompson means every note." \nwww.jefferyhyde.com\nwww.myspace.com

 onsiderable vocal and songwriting talents deliver unique\, compelling and h
 ighly enjoyable music ranging from contemplative ballads to upbeat bluegras
 s to belting blues\, our gutsy original tunes and carefully chosen covers c
 ombine personal introspective lyrics and soulful harmonies.\n\nwww.myspace.

DESCRIPTION:If there ever was a band that could realign the planets in our 
 solar system\, Left Foot Green could do it. Although Left Foot Green has on
 ly recently formed\, the organic rock that pours from every member of the b
 and has the power to enlighten all the senses as each note propels the ears
  of every listener to a sublime location. \n\nThe melodious roots of Left F
 oot Green sprawl deep into the Front Range music scene of Colorado. Foundin
 g members\, Justin Harned and Brad Jones\, first met in Boulder\, Colorado 
 in 2004. Little did they know that their musical talents would combine to f
 orm their original band\, The Stinos in 2006. The Stinos’ success drew them
  into illustrious venues such as Herman’s Hideaway\, Rock Bottom Brewery\, 
 and the Tivoli Student Center. The Stinos also had a short tour into the Mi
 dwest to play Steamboat Days in Burlington\, Iowa. \n\nIn spring of 2007\, 
 The Stinos released their first album\, Alchemy and Apathy\, with more than
  moderate success. Not long after\, The Stinos added Jimmy (bass) and Harmo
 ny (electric violin). Nine months and many talented grooves later\, the ban
 d happened upon Kelly (drums) and Left Foot Green was officially born. \n\n
 Left Foot Green is currently recording several hit songs at Plan 9 Studios 
 in Arvada\, Colorado engineered by Mike Henderson. The band plans on releas
 ing their first album in early 2009 and embarking on a regional tour soon a
 fter. \n\nLeft Foot Green has no intention of stopping until they’re on the
  top. With aspirations such as late night talk show gigs and someday tourin
 g the world\, Left Foot Green has what it takes to climb from the humble ro
 ots of Colorado to the farthest reaches of the earth. \n\n$3 cover\n\nwww.m

DESCRIPTION:Two Thin Dimes primarily play an American folk style of music c
 alled “old-time”\, which developed mainly from older English\, Scottish\, I
 rish and African folk traditions.  This is typically fiddle-driven dance mu
 sic\, but also includes ballads\, songs and other folk musical styles.  Two
  Thin Dimes feature the old-time fiddling and mandolin playing of Chad Yost
  and the old-time banjo and guitar playing of Carrie Jackson.  Most of thei
 r repertoire was learned note-for-note from historic field recordings and m
 odern old-time players.  Two thin dimes enjoy reviving the sounds of a bygo
 ne era by playing songs from the 19th and early 20th century\, often with h
 istoric instruments from the same period.\n\nmyspace.com/twothindimes

  traveling for 6 months in the middle east. Wadi Rum is a region in Jordan 
 where Erlich found himself miraculously healed after suffering a debilitati
 ng illness during his travels in the desert.\nThe music is much like the re
 gion: raw\, powerful\, silent and loud in turns\, and ultimately healing.\n
 WadiRum's songs build to crescendo\, with lush harmony\, dark\, warm bass a
 nd cello\, and drums that move from subtle to explosive. Each song is diffe
 rent\, but the message is the same- the revelation of the human heart.\n\nw

DESCRIPTION:myspace.com/basement3music\n\nso here's the story:\n\nMy name i
 s Kenny\, and I am an acoustic musician from San Francisco who is touring a
 cross the U.S.  in August - October 2008.  The music is avant-garde folk an
 d could be compared to Nick Drake\, Iron and Wine\, Gillian Welch\, or Elli
 ot Smith--I've even heard Paul Simon a few times. Audiences have been very 
 attracted to the a-typical guitar techniques.\n\nWe will be in the Denver a
 rea from August 31st - Sept. 4th and would love to get a show or 2--perhaps
  sharing the bill with a local?\n\nA little background:  \n\nI recently rel
 eased my 4th CD\, 'Under'\, written and recorded in Australia....i was ther
 e for one year with a girl I met on MySpace.  \n\nThis CD\, my first all ac
 oustic venture\, is a very unique documentation of this odd journey full of
  unexpected experiences... and...the journey is now coming full circle....w
 ith Sabiné (the Australian girl) coming to my shores in August to have a 'r
 everse' experience. We plan to travel from San Francisco to New York and ba
 ck again\, performing and creating new music (she's a musician too)\, exper
 iencing all parts of this country\, and compiling a 'book' and video docume
 ntary about our travels and lives as musicians. We will be highlighting our
  experience at the various venues we play and hope to talk to venue owners 
 and include some of their stories in our documentary. \n\nWe have secured s
 ome venues along the way including the infamous Blue Bird Cafe in Nashville
 . Here are some recent testimonials so I'm not just blowing my own horn....
 : ) :\n\nHere are some recent testimonials from live reviews and CD reviews
 :\n\n"Kenny is also very funny and engaging …. Musically\, he delves into t
 he experimental realm of contemporary folk by playing in unorthodox keys an
 d using unusual chord patterns. Much of his music is heavily influenced by 
 Bluegrass stylings. His fingerpicking style on the guitar is absolutely sup
 erb. He also demonstrated his mastery of use of the guitar body as a percus
 sive instrument….."\n\n"It is Schick's careful yet understated acoustic gui
 tar that makes “Under” shine\, providing sharp rhythms and often sweet melo
 dies with a hint of that folksy twang."\n\n"With a very raw and uncomplicat
 ed production style...Kenny Schick shines in this latest release."\n\n"The 
 lyrics suggest a melting and a rebirth and conjure images that I’d compare 
 to Dali’s melting clock."\n\n"In a hopelessly romantic and brazen move\, th
 e Bay area artist packed his bags and moved to Australia for a girl he had 
 only met through the wide world of the internet. I don't know how the relat
 ionship turned out\, but whatever passion\, pain and spontaneity Schick exp
 erienced created a rich and engrossing LP."\n\n"...there is an immense calm
  even in his lyrical musings that make you believe that it might be ok\, th
 at folk might be your salvation."\n\n"From his experience\, Schick has craf
 ted a starkly beautiful acoustic gem. His lyrics and vocals are personal an
 d confessional\; the instrumentation is organic. I’ve been listening to thi
 s one a lot lately\, discovering nuances with each spin."\n\n"Judging by th
 e acoustic folk soaked in sunny melodies and serious rhythms\, Australia wa
 s very good to him."\n\n"The warmth and immediacy of the production contrib
 utes to the heartfelt vibe of this disc. Kenny Schick's Under is crisp\, co
 ntemporary American folk music\, inspired by trip to the other side of the 
 world."\n\n"All the songs individually captivate me. But all together\, whe
 n I sit down and listen to the whole damn thing\, the album coalesces into 
 a single unit that is transportive. After listening through the whole album
  and being literally blown away\, I put my stereo on shuffle with the discs
  that just happened to be in there (Tom Waits -- "Rain Dogs"\; The Postal S
 ervice -- "Give Up"\; Gillian Welch -- "The Revelator"). Wow. Ever have one
  of those experiences where every song that comes on is your favorite?"\n\n
 Sabine and I very much look forward to meeting you.\n\n\nkindest regards\nK

DESCRIPTION:\nSophie Ramsay grew up in rural Scotland\, on the edge of the 
 Highlands.\nShe has always sung Scots songs\, since she was a little girl\,
  many of\nwhich she learnt from her parents\, and many of these\, they lear
 nt from\ntheir parents. At school and university\, Sophie sung chorally\,\n
 classically and operatically\, (holding choral and vocal scholarships\nduri
 ng her time at St Andrews University) but the old Scots songs\nalways ran a
 longside\, and Sophie prefers not to sing them in a\nclassical way. After u
 niversity she ran away to Paris for a year with\na ramshakled troupe of dar
 k eyed French musicians from conservatoire\nthere\, with whom she recorded 
 a CD of traditional Scots songs. Now she\nis also writing her own songs\, a
 nd incorporates them into her shows.\nAt the Edinburgh Festival Fringe\, a 
 reviewer for 'The Scotsman' wrote\n'This is a true taste of Scotland. Beaut
 iful person: beautiful songs\,\nbeautiful show.' She has also appeared on B
 BC Radio 4's Desert Island\nDiscs as one of 7 tracks chosen by writer\, Ror
 y Stewart\, recorded\nvocals for a BBC documentary on the declaration of hu
 man rights and\nperformed at Scotland's most prestigious folk festival\, Ce
 ltic\nConnections\, in Glasgow.

 rty\n\n\nSSP! is New York's official #1 brass band for BalkanSoulGypsyFunk.
   The 10-piece band is just what it says: an original mash-up of fiery Gyps
 y brass\, soulful Balkan anthems\, and hip-grinding American funk.  SSP! ha
 s played with Arcade Fire\, Gogol Bordello\, and the Warped Tour\, as well 
 as pasha's palaces in Istanbul\, Serbian schoolyards\, Lincoln Center in Ne
 w York\, steelworkers' dive bars in the midwest\, Chicago's Symphony Space\
 , and of course the band's Brooklyn home: the backroom of Barbès.  Vocalist
  Eva Salina joins the band on their first foray into the American west.\n\n
 \n\n"Of all the NYC dance bands that draw on Eastern European music\, Slavi
 c Soul Party! is the coolest.... SSP! jumps from traditional songs to conte
 mporary covers and originals\, connecting the dots of a number of folk scho
 ols with surprising finesse... Though all of these elements blend beautiful
 ly on the album\, SSP! shines brighter as a live band. Its members seem acu
 tely aware of the common principle that unites the traditions they borrow f
 rom: Music ought to move you." — Cristina Black\, TimeOut NY\n\n"Slavic Sou
 l Party are pretty much thebomb.com.  If you want to hear them before the b
 uzz absolutely deafens you\, check them out tonight..." — Whatsupnyc.com\n\
 n\n"...terrifying\, exhausting and way more aggressive than a lot of punk m
 usic I've seen." — Sufjan Stevens\, Rolling Stone\n

DESCRIPTION:"Plenty of sonic pleasures...add Crocker's attractive vocal\, a
 nd you have a nice little home-made record that grows on each listen." -Ame
 ricana UK review of "Death"\n"Crocker runs through 11 different settings to
  tell his stories in\, and he does it remarkably well. His voice ranges fro
 m almost a full on yell at times to a near whisper at others\, propelling h
 is powerful and complex lyrics...This is a meditative\, thoughtful record y
 ou can also play loud and smile with at times\, and that's a true accomplis
 hment." - centerfuse.net review of "Death"\n"Jon combines Country\, Folk an
 d partly Pop and out comes a perfect mix which goes under the skin...this i
 s great music and definitely something for mind\, body and soul. Fantastic 
 music\, fantastic voice\, fantastic recording...great stuff." -Daredevil Ma
 gazine\, February 2005 ( www.daredevil.de)\n"This man is no short of genius
 \, and if he wanted to become a house hold name I do not think he would hav
 e a problem doing so." -wnyo 88.9fm\, Oswego\, NY ( http://dolphinradio.blo
 gspot.com)\n"Crocker writes music that showcases his vocals and lyrics in a
  way that other music is simply not capable of." - musicgeek.org \n\n\n\na 
 bit about me: i usually play songs on guitar\, mandolin\, and banjo (and oc
 casionally piano\, if available)\, play some kind of percussion with my rig
 ht foot\, sing\, whistle\, play harmonica\, etc. (i will also likely have a
  couple of friends as my backing band on this tour). i typically play over 
 200 shows a year in the US\, canada\, and europe. you can read loads of bio
  stuff on my website\, and listen to music on my myspace page. here are the

DESCRIPTION:\nBIO: My name is Roni Zagoria and I'm 24 years old. I have bee
 n writing music since I was in the 6th grade and have been performing live 
 for 4 years now. I started off solo on the piano for the first two years pl
 aying all over the Southeast including Columbia and Charleston\, SC\, Atlan
 ta\, GA\, New Orleans and Baton Rouge. As a solo artist I opened for the li
 kes of Dirty Dozen Brass Band\, Lake Trout\, Zen Tricksters\, Derek Trucks 
 Band\, Tim Reynolds\, as well as headlining my own shows. I also won a Batt
 le of the Bands in South Carolina which enabled me to play in a festival wi
 th MOE.\, Dr. John and Karl Denson. I then played in a band for two years a
 nd was accepted into the Atlantis Music Conference in Atlanta. I've recentl
 y been singing with Cosmis Charlie\,the "high energy" Grateful dead cover b
 and as well. After taking a long break\, I have just moved across the count
 ry to Boulder from Georgia\, and am stoked to delve into its music scene as
  a solo piano singer/songwriter once more. If you like mainly original musi
 c with a soulful vibe and a touch of the blues\, come check me out. I'm new
  in town and don't know a soul\, so I'm always looking to meet some rad mus
 ic lovers.

DESCRIPTION:New Book Connects Family\, America and the Khmer Rouge\nKari Gr
 ady Grossman will be speaking about her upcoming book\n\nApril 17 marks the
  32 year anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia and the public
 ation of a new book spanning three decades between genocide and justice.  A
 pril also marks the Cambodian New Year\; 2007 will truly be a new year if t
 he United Nations follows through with its long-awaited prosecution of the 
 Khmer Rouge war criminals.\n\nAmerican author Kari Grady Grossman has penne
 d a compelling account of how the adoption of her Cambodian son awakened a 
 personal connection to these tragic events and the resulting destitution in
  modern day Cambodia\, inspiring her to make a difference.\n\nBones that Fl
 oat\, A Story of Adopting Cambodia takes you into the Khmer Rouge jungle wh
 ere  boy soldiers force starving families to labor all day at gunpoint\, an
 d it brings you to modern-day Phnom Penh streets where foreign pedophiles p
 urchase the innocence of preteeen Cambodian girls.  But ultimately\, Bones 
 that Float--a cambodian phrase for the sacred that rises above suffering--i
 s a tale of hope.  Grossman reminds us that our world is 'one big family' a
 nd that we cannot--or dare not--turn our backs on people who suffer in part
  because of our country's own foreign policy missteps.\n\nThe author joins 
 the growing trend of writers who reject an advance from a major publishing 
 house and choose instead a small\, independent publisher that offers greate
 r control of their work.  In Ms. Grossman's case\, her work will fund her e
 ducation mission in Cambodia.  Via Wild Heaven Press\, 25% of the book's pr
 oceeds are donated to Friends of the Grady Grossman School\, a non-profit 5
 01(c)(3) charitable organization that supports a Cambodian school Ms. Gross
 man and her husband founded in their son's honor in 2001.\n\nRemarkably\, s
 tudents from the Grady Grossman School\, the first in their remote village 
 to learn to read and write\, were recently featured iby Voice of America  f
 or their letter writing campaign to demand law enforcement for forest crime
 s and corruption in their community.  Also\, look for an upcoming Voice of 
 America feature on author Grossman and Bones that Float.\n\nBones that Floa
 t\, A Story of Adopting Cambodia will be available at major bookstores and 
 online booksellers\, however\, the most net dollars per book go to educatio
 n in Cambodia when it is purchased direct from www.BonesThatFloat.com\, or 
 by mail order to Wild Heaven Press\, PO Box 65 Lander\, Wyoming 82520.  The
  price is $24.95 plus $5 shipping/handling.\n\nWebsites:\nThe Book: www.Bon

 rs and perform other important social responsibilities.\n\nGriot people are
  highly respected and potentially feared among the community. They hold gre
 at power and use it in their ability to speak to people about current issue
 s and politics. Generally\, they communicate through song. Men often sing w
 hile playing the kora – a 21-stringed harp-lute or\, sometimes\, the sabar

 . \n\n"The Elephant Revival Concept (E.R.C.) is a collaboration of four ver
 y talented\, dynamic and distinctive songwriters\, musicians and singers wh
 o meld into something in-all-ways wonderful. Although a relatively young mu
 sical entity E.R.C. consisting of Daniel Rodriquez\, of Mystic\, CT (singer
 \, guitar\, fiddle\, banjo\,)\, Bridget Law\, of Boulder\, CO. (singer\, fi
 ddle\, mandolin\, guitar)\, Dango Rose\, of Chicago\, Il. (upright bass\, s
 inger\, mandolin\, banjo)\, and Sage T. Cook (banjo\, mandolin\, singer) ha
 s already acquired a large\, diverse\, and loyal following in Colorado\, Ne
 w Mexico\, the Mid-West\, and New England. The music is virtually all origi
 nal with all members contributing songs and compositions. The band is influ
 enced by traditional forms and has strong roots in reggae\, bluegrass\, roc
 k\, folk and jazz. The underlying groove remains fresh by maintaining a mod
 est hip-hop sensibility. Overall the sound is new musical wine in a new bot
 tle with a powerful vitality that gets a room moving and dancing\, strong w
 ord that gets an audience thinking\, amidst the power of trance. Some of th
 e most distinctive parts of the music are the original songs and powerful v
 ocals\, Bridget's stirring Scottish fiddle\, Dango's Groove\, Daniel's uniq
 ue fingerstyle guitar and Sage's one of kind banjo style. However\, the col
 laboration and the harmonies become far greater than the parts." The Elepha
 nt Revival Concept is lucky to be graced with the presence of Bonnie Paine 
 on Vocals and Percussion when she is able. -Sam Libby (author/journalist) "
 It is refreshing to hear contemplative\, beautiful music played by young pe
 ople." -John Cowan "This band reminds me of elements of Tha MuseMeant." -Da

DESCRIPTION: Artist Information\n\nInstrumentation\nBeth Preston: guitar an
 d vocals\nJesse Charnow: Drum Kit\nJess Latham: Drums and Percussion\n\n\n\
 nBiography\nwww.myspace.com/bethpreston\n\n\nBeth Preston: just a girl tryi
 ng to spread the love. \n\nBut it’s not all rainbows\, moonbeams and fairyt
 ales for this Southern-Californian musician. Try lightning bolts\, skateboa
 rds and broken guitar strings\, and you’re getting a little closer to the r
 eal Beth Preston. Oh\, and she also loves puppies.\n\nFrustration\, heartac
 he\, uncertainty\, acceptance and strength of mind can all be found in Pres
 ton’s music – what else can one expect from a vegan and political activist 
 living in a George-Bush-led America?\n\nNot just another angry folk-rocker\
 , this girl’s got a ‘light that shines and fire that burns’.  She’s exposin
 g the roots and finding the flow – both lyrically and musically.  Preston’s
  amazing vocals and soulful performances have landed her support slots with
  Xavier Rudd\, Michael Franti & Spearhead\, and Blue King Brown\, to name j
 ust a few.  \n\nWith her musical journey beginning at age zero\, Preston is
  not stranger to performing. Her first gig being “..in the parking lot of o
 ne of my Mom’s gigs\, with a tip jar\, and a kid-sized accordion..”  \n\nAs
 ide from her more recognized musical influences (PJ Harvey\, Ani Difranco\,
  Cat Power\, Elliot Smith\, Jeff Buckley\, Manu Chao\, Hendrix\, etc) her p
 arents have been a huge inspiration\, “ My mom is the most amazing blues si
 nger and poet I've ever witnessed\, and my father\, a world-class guitarist
  and writer...”\n\nHer upbringing\, huge heart\, and burning desire to comm
 unicate her beliefs and feelings through music\, create a performer who’s n
 ot afraid to explore her musical boundaries\, and who definitely is not shy
  to the stage! Anyone who’s seen a Beth Preston gig will know\, she owns it
 .\n\nThis Australian tour she is also sharing that stage with another Calif
 ornian based musician\, drum ‘prodigy’\, Jesse Charnow. Sharing his talent 
 between numerous musicians\, including Ravi Shankar and daughter Anoushka\,
  Charnow’s presence will no doubt add fuel to Preston’s fire. This on-stage
  burner is completed with beats from Brisbane-based percussionist Jess Lath
 am. \n\nThis is not Preston’s first time to Australia\, a place that contin
 ually amazes and inspires her\, and luckily for her fans\, she’s more than 
 happy to spend the next few months here. \n\nKicking it off at the Folk\, R
 hythm  & Life Festival in Victoria\, with plenty of shows to follow\, there
  will no doubt be an opportunity for everyone to come on down and share the
  lurrrve – Beth-Preston style.\n\n‘Chaos is natural\, and fire can be as be
 autiful as blue sky…’ \n\n\nWebsite\nhttp://www.BethPreston.com\n\nDiscogra
 phy\nEP -  'great big wave' Has had  airplay in Australia\,  Canada\,  the 
 US\n**Stay tuned for full length album to be released in Dec 2006!!**\n

 brings to the community the true\ncharacter and spirit of musics from the c
 lassical Egyptian repertoire which is\nmuch loved throughout the Middle Eas
 t\; from the Fertile Crescent\; from diverse\nregions of Morocco and North 
 Africa\; and also the mezmerizing music of the\nArabian Gulf. \n\n\nAs a ch
 ild\, growing up in Fez\, Morocco\, Rachid played the ney and sang\,\nimita
 ting the famous singers of the time. At age fourteen he entered "Dar\nAadyi
 l" the Conservatory of Music in Fez. At first he studied Western classical\
 nand Andalus music on piano and violin. He soon expanded to include a varie
 ty of\nother instruments in order to better express his native music. In ad
 dition to\nhis voice\, his strongest instruments are the oud (similar to a 
 lute without\nfrets) and the violin\, which he plays in both the classical 
 manner and upright\nresting on the knee for Moroccan folkloric music. \n\n\
 nUntil 1986\, Rachid played in an Andalus orchestra in Fez\, and at various
 \noccasions throughout Casablanca. Then\, over a span of fourteen years\, h
 e\npresented his music to a more varied audience. This included an extended
  stay in\nthe Ivory Coast\; one year in Sweden\; one year in Finland\, wher
 e he and his seven\npiece band played at the Helsinki International Music F
 estival sharing the bill\nwith Cheb Khaled\; and in the coastal city of Aga
 dir\, Morocco\, Rachid fully\nmanaged a night club\, its musicians\, and fo
 lkloric troupe for seven of those\nyears\, playing his music every night fo
 r the club's primarily touristic and\nArabian clientele. On his violin\, he
  accompanied many of Morocco's well known\nsingers who toured to Agadir. On
  many occasions he played with Mohammed Abdo\,\none of the Arabian Gulf's m
 ost loved singers. During two years\, Rachid was\ninvited numerous times to
  the Arabian Gulf as a singer and oud player in his own\nright. \n\n\nIn Su
 mmer 2004 Rachid toured the USA with The Chicago Classical Oriental\nEnsemb
 le playing Moroccan Andalus music with Abdelfattah Bennis\, including\nGene
 sis at the Crossroads Festival in Chicago. He was presented at Columbia\nUn
 iversity in concert with visiting Israeli singer\, Michel Cohen\, with Moro
 ccan\nsinger Pinhas in New York and Miami\, as well as other ethnic concert

DESCRIPTION:Sunday Oct 22\, 2006\, 7:30-10:30 pm\n\nThe Body Electric\n\nTh
 e Body Electric's first show in December 2005 featured two drummers\, a rho
 des keyboard\, Spanish and electric guitars\, a mandolin\, a violin\, a ban
 jo\, a melodica and a glockenspiel. This seemingly unlikely combination of 
 sounds was harnessed into a powerful pop performance that forecasted what t
 he ever-evolving collective had in store. The band was originally conceived
  as a full power space rock outfit and misguided tribute to Issac Asimov by
  singer/guitarist Sam Cooper (formerly of local act Francophone) in summer 
 2005.\n\nAfter inviting opera student and piano virtuoso Shenandoah Davis t
 o the group\, elements of classical music began seeping into the songs\, op
 ening the flood gates to a barrage of eclectic genres.\n\nThe band's curren
 t line-up of guitar/keys/drums/bass/flute/saxophone/banjo/mandolin drifts s
 eamlessly through bluegrass\, jazz\, rock\, classical\, reggae\, and even k
 lezmer\, all while retaining an indie folk sensibility and genuine love for
  all of mankind at the root of all else.

DESCRIPTION:Saturday Oct 21\, 2006\, 8:30-10:30 pm\n\nCounty Road X – Sugge
 sted cover: $7.00\n\nOne the most exciting elements of modern music is the 
 incorporation of foreign instrumentation into a defined "genre." Perhaps th
 e unique combination of instruments used by Boulder\, Colorado's County Roa
 d X contributes to the difficulty of categorizing their music.\nThe group c
 onsists of Erik Deutsch (piano)\,\nDoug Anderson (bass/accordian)\,\nGlenn 
 Taylor (pedal-steel/percussion)\,\nJames Hoskins (cello)\,\nTaddVancil (dru
 ms) and\nKevin Hendricks (glockenspiel/crotales).\n\nThe result of the ense
 mble is a series of lush arrangements that yield dissonant crescendos and w
 himsical\, melodies. Deutsch\, Anderson and Vancil provide a steady rhythm 
 section complimented by the meandering fills of Taylor and Hoskins. Hendric
 ks' subtle compliments thicken the mixture. CRX's music evokes landscapes a
 nd movement\, like a road trip of sound.
