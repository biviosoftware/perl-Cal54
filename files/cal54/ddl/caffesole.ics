DESCRIPTION:Barton Carroll:\n\nA North Carolina native who now lives in Sea
 ttle\, Carroll’s songs are structured in folk traditions he grew up with\, 
 but he trades in standard instrumentation for the west Coast horn sound of 
 Craig Flory\, and the production of Jazz bassist\, Matt Weiner. The three b
 onded over a love of the Gerry Mulligan and Paul Desmond records of the 196
 0's\, and the influence comes through. He also sings his first duets with S
 eattle singer Anna Lisa Notter.\n\nbartoncarroll.com\n\nno cover
